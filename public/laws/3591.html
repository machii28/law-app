<LI>Should any insured bank fail or refuse to pay any assessment required to be paid by such bank under any provision of this Act, and should the bank not correct such failure or refusal within thirty days after written notice has been given by the Corporation to an officer of the bank, citing this subsection, and stating that the bank has failed or refused to pay as required by law the insured status of such bank shall be terminated by the Board of Directors. The remedies provided in this subsection and in the two preceding subsections shall not be construed as limiting any other remedies against an insured bank but shall be in addition thereto.<BR>
<LI>Trust funds held by an insured bank in a fiduciary capacity whether held in trust or deposited in any other department or in another bank shall be insured like other forms of deposits, in an amount not to exceed P10,000 for each trust estate, and when deposited by the fiduciary bank in another insured bank such trust funds shall be similarly insured to the fiduciary bank according to the trust estates represented. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, such insurance shall be separate from and additional to that covering other deposits of the owners of such trust funds or the beneficiaries of such trust estates: <EM>Provided,</EM>  That where the fiduciary bank deposits any of such trust funds in other insured banks, the amount so held by other insured banks on deposit shall not for the purpose of any certified statement required under subsections (b) and (c) of this section be considered to be a deposit liability of the fiduciary bank but shall be considered to be a deposit liability of the bank in which such funds are so deposited by such, fiduciary bank.  The Board of Directors shall have the power by regulation to prescribe the manner of reporting and of depositing such trust funds.</LI></OL><BR><BR>SEC. 7. 
<OL type=a>
<LI>Any insured bank may, upon not loss than ninety days, written notice to the Corporation, and to the Development Bank of the Philippines if it owns or holds as pledges any preferred stock; capital notes, or debentures of such bank, terminate its status as an insured bank.  Whenever the Board of Directors shall find that an insured bank or its directors or trustees have continued unsafe or unsound practices in conducting the business of the bank or which have knowingly or negligently permitted any of its officers or agents to violate any provisions of any law or regulation to which the insured bank is subject, the Board of Directors shall first give to the Central Bank of the Philippines a statement with respect to such practices or violations for the purpose of securing the correction thereof and shall give a copy thereof to the bank.  Unless such correction shall be made within one hundred twenty days or such shorter period of time as the Central Bank of the Philippines shall require, the Board of Directors, if it shall determine to proceed further, shall give to the bank not less than thirty days written notice of intention to determine the status of the bank as an insured bank, and shall fix a time and place for a hearing before the Board of Directors or before person designated by it to conduct such hearing, at which evidence may be produced,  and upon such evidence the Board of Directors shall make written findings which shall be conclusive.  Unless the bank shall appear at the hearing by a duly authorized representative, it shall deemed to have consented to the termination of its status as an insured bank.  If the Board of Directors shall find that any unsafe or unsound practice or violation specified in such notice has been established and has not been corrected within the time above prescribed in which make to such correction, the Board of Directors may order that the insured status of the bank be terminated on a date subsequent to such finding and to the expiration of the time specified in such notice of intention.  The Corporation may publish notice of such termination and the bank shall give notice of such termination to each of the depositors at his last address of record on the books of the bank, in such a manner and at such a time as the Board of Directors may find to be necessary and may order for the protection of the depositors.  After the termination of the insured status of any bank under the provisions of this subsection, the insured deposits of each depositor in the bank on the date of such termination, less all subsequent withdrawals from any deposits of such depositor, shall continue for a period of two years to be insured, and the bank shall continue to pay to the Corporation assessments as in the case of an insured bank during such period.  No additions to any such deposits and no new deposits in such bank made after the date of such termination shall be insured by the Corporation, and the bank shall not advertise or hold itself out as having insured deposits unless in the same connection it shall also state with equal prominence that such additions to deposits and new deposits made after such date are not insured.  Such bank shall, in all other respects, be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured bank for the period of two years from the date of such termination, and in the event that such bank shall be closed on account of insolvency within such period of two years, the Corporation shall have the same powers and rights with respect to such bank as in case of an insured bank.<BR>
<LI>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever the Board of Directors shall determine that an insured banking institution is not engaged in the business of receiving deposits, the Corporation shall notify the banking institution that its insured status will terminate at the expiration of the first full semiannual assessment period following such notice.  A finding by the Board of Directors that a banking institution is not engaged in the business of receiving deposits shall be conclusive.  The Board of Directors shall prescribe the notice to be given by the banking institution of such termination and the Corporation may publish notice thereof.  Upon the termination of the insured status of any such banking institution, its deposits shall thereupon cease to be insured and the banking institution shall thereafter be relieved of all future obligations to the Corporation, including the obligation to pay future assessments.<BR>
<LI>Whenever the liabilities of an insured bank for deposits shall have been assumed by another insured bank or banks, the insured status of the bank whose liabilities are so assumed shall terminate on the date of receipt by the Corporation of satisfactory evidence of such assumption with like effect as if its insured status had been terminated on said date by the Board of Directors after proceedings under subsection (a) of this section: Provided, That if the bank whose liabilities are so assumed gives to its depositors notice of such assumption within thirty days after such assumption takes effect, by publication or by any reasonable means, in accordance with regulations to be prescribed by the Board of Directors, the insurance of its deposits shall terminate at the end of six months from the date such assumption takes effect.  Such bank shall be subject to the duties and obligations of an insured bank for the period its deposits are insured: <EM>Provided, further,</EM> That if the deposits are assumed by a newly insured bank, the bank whose deposits are assumed shall not be required to pay any assessment upon the deposit which have been so assumed after the semiannual period in which the assumption takes effect.</LI></OL><BR><BR>SEC. 8.
