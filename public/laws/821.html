<OL type=a>
<LI>A farmers cooperative association shall be a voluntary business organization among farmers (producers of agricultural products including tenants and landlords) established for the purpose of marketing farm products and/or buying farm supplies and implements collectively for the members' direct benefit. It is governed according to the cooperative principles of one-man-one-vote basis, limited interest on capital and the savings apportioned among the members on the basis of patronage. <BR>
<LI>The term "small farmer" shall mean an individual person who exclusively uses the labor available from within his family, and is actually engaged in agriculture.</LI></OL><BR>SEC. 13. <EM>Credit to small farmers.</EM>—Credit extended to small farmers, either with titles or no titles over their lands, whether tenants or part owners, should be based upon the anticipated productive capacity of farmers insofar as repayment probabilities are concerned: <EM>Provided, however,</EM> that the amount does not exceed two thousand pesos. Such loans may be granted for the purchase of fertilizer, seed, feed, work animals and corresponding tillage equipment, poultry, livestock and such other items specified by regulations as are directly related to the production of crops and livestock. The ability of such a borrower to provide security in the form of land or other tangible securities should not be the primary deciding factor in approving or disapproving a loan. Instead, the size of the loan should be predicated upon his production with other security being considered as supplemental. In instances where credit is extended for items which are not consumed in their use, such items should be pledged as security, but in such cases approval of the loan should be dependent upon the borrower's productive capacity after receiving the item rather than upon the return which can be anticipated in the event of forced sale of the item. Loans made to farmers should be conditioned upon compliance by them with those proven practices which are reasonably within their capacity to carry out and will result in the maximum income and production from such farming units. The supervision necessary to insure full implementation of this policy will be maintained by the Administration. <BR><BR>SEC. 14. <EM>Terms of loans.</EM>—The terms of loans made to farmers should be adjusted to the needs of the borrower with special attention being given to the following: <BR><BR>
<OL type=a>
<LI>Making the duration of the loan consistent with the period of time necessary to permit repayment by the borrower front his production. <BR>
<LI>Adjusting the terms of repayment to the borrower's income from his production. Where necessary the repayment of the loan should be amortized over a period of time which will permit installment payments which are within the borrower's income. <BR>
<LI>Granting extensions in the time for repayment when damages and destruction caused by insects, disease, weather and other causes beyond the power of the borrower to control occur. <BR>
<LI>Since the production of the borrower must serve as the primary security, such production should be pledged as security with appropriate safeguards being taken to insure against unauthorized disposition. <BR>
<LI>When the Administration considers such to be necessary to insure repayment, it may require a borrower to enter into a marketing agreement covering the terms which must be complied with, including notice to the Administration and manner of disposition of the produce covered by the contract. The duration of such contract shall be terminated when the borrower has complied with his obligation to the Administration. <BR>
<LI>In the event of any breach or threatened breach of a marketing contract by a borrower, the Administration shall be entitled to an injunction and a decree of specific performance. Also, upon filing a verified complaint showing a breach or threatened, breach, the Administration shall be entitled to a temporary restraining order against such borrower.</LI></OL><BR>SEC. 15. <EM>Loan to cooperatives.</EM>—Loan shall be made to any cooperative association, if in the judgment of the board of directors of the association concerned, the loan is in furtherance of the policy declared in section one and the cooperative association applying for the loan has an organization and management, and business policies, of such character as to insure the reasonable safety of the loan and the furtherance of such policy. No cooperative association shall be entitled to apply for a loan unless it has been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The provision of existing cooperative laws regarding minimum number of members shall apply to cooperative associations mentioned in this Act. <BR><BR>Loans for the construction or acquisition by purchase of such facilities shall be subject to the following limitations: <BR><BR>
<OL type=a>
<LI>Loans for the construction or acquisition by purchase of such facilities may be made in an amount equivalent to one hundred <EM>per centum</EM> of the value of the facilities to be constructed: <EM>Provided, however,</EM> That the facilities meet the following requirements: <BR><BR>
<OL>
<LI>All major parts must be completely of steel or concrete materials; <BR>
<LI>If ten annual amortizations will fully pay back for the loans.</LI></OL><BR><BR>
<LI>Loans for facilities not meeting the above-mentioned requirements may be made, provided the amount is not in excess of eighty <EM>per centum</EM> of the value of the facilities, to be constructed or purchased. <BR>
<LI>No loan for the purchase of facilities shall be made unless the board of directors of the association concerned finds that the purchase price to be paid is reasonable. <BR>
<LI>No loan for the construction or purchase of such facilities shall be made unless the board of directors of the cooperative association finds that there are not available suitable existing facilities that will furnish their services to the cooperative association at reasonable rates, and in addition to the preceding limitations, no loan shall be made unless the said board finds that suitable facilities are not available for purchase or lease at a reasonable price or rent.</LI></OL><BR>SEC. 16. Interest in all kinds of loans shall not be more than eight <EM>per centum per annum</EM>. Loans to any cooperative association shall be made upon the terms specified in this Act and upon such other terms not inconsistent therewith and upon such security the Board of Governors may deem necessary. Loans may be subjected to a five <EM>per centum</EM> insurance fee which is to be paid at the time the loan is granted. <BR><BR>SEC. 17. Personal short term loans to members in good standing with cooperatives may be granted by the association from funds which it may receive in advance from the Administration for the said purpose; such loans may be granted against warehouse receipt of the Cooperative Association to the extent of eighty <EM>per centum</EM> of the market value of the stored produce; loans upon the security of expected production from the current crop to the extent of sixty per cent of the value of expected yield: <EM>Provided, however,</EM> That no loan shall be granted on any production estimated to exceed the applicant's previous year's stored crop with the Cooperative by more than fifty <EM>per centum</EM>. <BR><BR>SEC. 18. <EM>Transfer of functions, personnel, and equipment of the Cooperatives Administration Office.</EM>—All the powers vested in and the duties conferred upon the Cooperatives Administration Office by Commonwealth Act Numbered Five hundred and sixty-five, as amended by Commonwealth Act Numbered Seven hundred and thirteen, relative to the promotion, organization and supervision of Cooperative Marketing Associations as authorized by Act Numbered Three thousand four hundred and twenty-five and such number of personnel and equipment as are now used and utilized in the promotion, organization and supervision of said cooperative marketing associations by the cooperatives Administration Office and the unexpended balance of the funds provided for in Commonwealth Act numbered Seven hundred and thirteen and Republic Act numbered Five hundred and eighty-three, are hereby absorbed by, and transferred to the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration. <BR><BR><BR>
