<OL>
<LI>If such excess is greater than the total amount payable under the certificate of claim issued in connection with such property, the Commission shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount so payable, and any excess remaining thereafter shall be paid to the mortgagor of such property; and<BR>
<LI>If such excess is equal to or less than the total amount payable under such certificate of claim, the Commission shall pay to the holder of such certificate the full amount of such claim.</LI></OL><BR><BR>(g) The aggregate amount at any one time of all such debentures issued to mortgagees with respect to mortgages or loans insured under this Act shall be fixed by the Commission with the approval of the President after consultation with the Monetary Board, which shall in no case exceed the aggregate amount of the outstanding principal obligations of all mortgages insured under this Act.</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>
