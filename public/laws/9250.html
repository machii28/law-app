The radio spectrum is a finite resource that is part of the national patrimony and the use thereof is a privilege conferred upon the grantee by the State and may be withdrawn anytime after due process. <BR><BR>SEC. 6. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Term of Franchise.</SPAN> — This franchise shall be for a term of twenty-five (25) years from the date of effectivity of this Act, unless sooner revoked or cancelled.
