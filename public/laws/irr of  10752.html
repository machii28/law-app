The BSP and the professional association of appraisers shall not be accountable for any acts of the IPAs stated in the list.<BR><BR>Whenever applicable, priority shall be given to the engagement of the services of a GFI.<BR><BR>The IA may use the appraisal reports of the GFI or IPA as one of the bases of the IA's price offer for negotiated sale, consistent with the standards for assessment under Section 12 of this IRR. For this purpose, the IA is encouraged to develop its in-house personnel capable of validating appraisal reports.<BR><BR><B>6.3 Terms of Reference for GFis and IPAs</B><BR><BR>As basis for the engagement of the services of a GFI or IPA, the IA shall prepare the Terms of Reference (TOR) for the services.

<LI>In provinces, cities, municipalities and other areas where there is no land classification, the city or municipal assessor is hereby mandated within the period of sixty (60) days from the date of filing of the expropriation case, to come up with the required land classification and the corresponding declaration of real property and improvement for the area. In provinces, cities, municipalities and other areas where there is no zonal valuation, or where the current zonal valuation has been in force for more than three (3) years, the BIR is mandated within the period of sixty (60) days from the date of filing of the expropriation case, to conduct a zonal valuation for said area, based on the land classification done by the city or municipal assessor.<BR><BR>
<LI>With reference to item (a)(l) of Section 7 of this IRR, in case the completion of a government infrastructure project is of utmost urgency and importance, and there is no land classification or no existing zonal valuation of the area concerned or the zonal valuation has been in force for more than three (3) years, the IA shall use the BIR zonal value and land classification of similar lands within the adjacent vicinity as the basis for the valuation.<BR><BR>

ACQUISITION OF PROPERTIES UNDER CA 141</B><BR><BR>As provided in Section 4 of the Act, in cases of lands granted through CA No. 141, dated 07 November 1936, known as the Public Land Act, and its amendments, the IA shall: 
<OL type=a>
<LI>follow the other modes of acquisition enumerated in this IRR, if the landowner is not the original patent holder and any previous acquisition of said land is not through a gratuitous title; or<BR><BR>
<LI>follow the provisions under CA No. 141 regarding acquisition of ROW on patent lands, if the landowner is the original patent holder or the acquisition of the land from the original patent holder is through a gratuitous title.</LI></OL>With respect to Section 8b above, under the provisions of CA No. 141, particularly Section 112, a ROW strip not exceeding 20 meters in width within the land acquired under that law is reserved by the government for public use with damages to improvements only. CA No. 141 was amended by Presidential Decree (PD) No. 635, dated 07 January 1975, which increased the ROW strip reserved for public use to a width not exceeding 60 meters.<BR><BR>If the government decides to exercise its right to use the ROW strip reserved for public use within the land acquired under CA No. 141, the owner is required to execute a quit claim. The IA shall then take possession of the property affected by the ROW without any compensation to the owner for the land, but  shall pay the owner the cost of the damages for the improvements within that land equivalent to their replacement cost as determined in accordance with Section 6.6 of this IRR. If the owner refuses or is unable to issue a quit claim, the concerned government officials responsible for the implementation of projects are authorized to immediately take possession of the portion of property  subject of the lien, as the need arises and upon due notice to the owner. This is without prejudice to the IA resorting to appropriate proceedings to acquire immediate possession of the property.<BR><BR>PD No. 1381 also allows the government to utilize the reserved ROW strip for temporary buildings for Resident and or Project Engineers needed in the prosecution of an infrastructure project. Once the infrastructure project is completed and the temporary buildings used by Resident/Project Engineers are no longer needed, the possession of the portion of property used for the building shall revert to the title holders.<BR><BR>The IA shall extend financial assistance to the property owner in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order No. 1035, series of 1985.<BR><BR><B>Section 9. EXCHANGE OR BARTER</B><BR><BR>Instead of being paid the money value of his property, the owner of a property needed for a ROW of a national government project may request the government to exchange or barter an old abandoned government road or other government property near the project with his said property. The IA may favorably consider this mode, subject to the provisions of relevant laws and the following conditions: 
<OL type=a>
<LI>The exchange shall be done on a "value-for-value" basis, i.e., the properties being exchanged are equivalent in market value or price;<BR><BR>
<LI>If the government property to be exchanged with the private property was originally donated by a previous owner, the donation must be verified to ensure that there is no condition which prohibits the government from disposing of it to other private persons. If the said government property was originally acquired through sale, the previous owner shall have the first priority to re-acquire the property if required by law or by the contract or deed of sale;<BR><BR>
<LI>Owners of property whose land abut the said abandoned government road or other property shall not be deprived of access, i.e., egress or ingress, to the new highway to be built, if any; and<BR><BR>
<LI>The private property owner and the IA which are parties to the exchange or barter agreement shall be subject to applicable CGT and DST in accordance with BIR rules and regulations.</LI></OL><B>Section 10. EASEMENT OF RIGHT-OF-WAY</B><BR><BR>If the portion of a lot needed for a ROW is minimal, such that the expenses for surveying or segregating that portion from the main lot would be very much more than the value of the part of the lot needed, the IA may, if the property owner agrees, resort to the mode of Easement of ROW provided under the Civil Code.<BR><BR>Under this mode, a ROW easement agreement shall be executed by the property owner and the IA whereby the former will grant the latter the right to use the affected portion of the lot as ROW, but the owner retains ownership of that portion of the lot.<BR><BR>The IA shall pay the owner the value of that portion of the lot based on the existing zonal valuation declared by the BIR. In addition, the IA shall compensate the property owner the replacement cost of any improvements and structures on the land affected by the ROW in accordance with Section 6.6 of this IRR. Entry by the IA to the acquired property may be effected upon full payment of the value of the property. The IA may engage the services of an IPA to determine the amount of the easement to be paid.<BR><BR>The mode of ROW acquisition through easement agreement may also be used in government agency-to-agency transactions, including those involving government-owned and controlled corporations.<BR><BR>The IA shall cause the registration of all ROW easement agreements with the Register of Deeds concerned within ten (I0) days from the date of their execution. The Register of Deeds shall annotate on the respective titles the agreements within seven (7) days from receipt thereof.<BR><BR><B>Section 11. ACQUISITION OF SUBSURFACE RIGHT-OF-WAY</B><BR><BR>As provided in Section 4 of the Act, when it is necessary to build, construct, or install on the subsurface or subterranean portion of private and government owned lands owned, occupied or leased by other persons, such infrastructure as subways, tunnels, underpasses, waterways, floodways, or utility facilities as part of the government's infrastructure and development project, the government or any of its authorized representatives shall not be prevented from entry into and use of such private and government lands by surface owners or occupants, if such entry and use are made more than fifty (50) meters from the surface.<BR><BR>The IA shall duly consult with and notify the affected property owners of any acquisition of subsurface right of way needed for the infrastructure projects.<BR><BR>If the national government project involves underground works within a depth of fifty (50) meters from the surface, the IA may undertake the mode of acquisition in the following order: 
<OL type=a>
<LI>Negotiate with the property owner a perpetual easement of ROW for the subterranean portions of his property required by the project; and<BR><BR>
<LI>Offer to acquire from the property owner the affected portion of the land, including the affected  structures, improvements, crops and trees therein in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</LI></OL>To assist the IA in determining (a) the appropriate price offer for the perpetual easement of the ROW under Section 11a of this IRR or (b) the appropriate price offer for the entire affected land including structures, improvement, crops and trees under Section 11b of this IRR, the IA may engage the services of a GFI or an IPA, in accordance with the procedure provided in Section 6 of this IRR. The easement price under Section 11a of this IRR shall be twenty percent (20%) of the market price of the land.<BR><BR>The IA shall follow the other rules for negotiated sale provided in Section 6 of this IRR.<BR><BR><B>Section 12. STANDARDS FOR ASSESSMENT FOR NEGOTIATED SALE</B><BR><BR>As provided in Section 7 of the Act, in order to facilitate the determination of the market value of the property, the following relevant standards shall be observed: 
<OL type=a>
<LI>The classification and use for which the property is suited based on, among other things, the latest approved land use plan and or zoning ordinance, if any, of the city or municipality concerned;<BR><BR>
<LI>The development cost for improving the land based on, among other things, the records and estimates of the City or Municipal Assessor  concerned, GFI or IPA for similar or comparable lands;<BR><BR>
<LI>The value declared  by the owners based on the value shown in the owners' latest Tax Declaration Certificates or Sworn Statements;<BR><BR>
<LI>The current selling price of similar lands in the vicinity based on, among other things, the latest records on Deeds of Sale for similar lands in the office of the Register of Deeds concerned;<BR><BR>
<LI>The reasonable  disturbance  compensation  for the removal and/or demolition of certain improvements on the land and for the value of improvements thereon considering, among other things, the replacement cost of improvements at current market prices as provided in Section 6.6 of this IRR;<BR><BR>
<LI>The size, shape or location, tax declaration and zonal valuation of the land based on, among other things, the latest records on Deeds of Sale in the Register of Deeds, tax declaration by the City or Municipal Assessor, zonal valuation of the BIR for comparable properties;<BR><BR>The price of the land as manifested in the ocular findings, oral as well as documentary evidence presented; and<BR><BR>
<LI>Such facts and events so as to enable the affected property owners to have sufficient funds to acquire similarly situated lands of approximate areas as those required from them by the government, and thereby rehabilitate themselves as early as possible.</LI></OL>In all cases, the increase in the value of the affected property brought about by the government project itself shall not be considered in the determination of the purchase price.<BR><BR>As provided in Section 6.3 of this IRR, the Terms of Reference, which shall be used by the GFIs and IPAs in the determination of the market value of the land, should include the applicable standards stated in this Section.<BR><BR><B>Section 13. ECOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS</B><BR><BR>As provided in Section 8 of the Act, in cases involving the acquisition of ROW, site or location for any national government infrastructure project, the IA shall take into account the ecological and environmental impact of the project. Before any national government project could be undertaken, the IA shall consider environmental laws, land use ordinances, and all pertinent provisions of RA No. 7160.<BR><BR>During the feasibility study/detailed engineering design of the projects, except for Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Projects, the IA shall secure from the DENR an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) or Certificate of Non-Coverage (CNC), as the case may be, in accordance with PD No. 1586 and its IRR. In the case of ancestral domain, additional requirements in accordance with RA No. 8371 and its IRR must be complied with.<BR><BR>The IA shall also prepare a Preliminary Land Acquisition Plan and Resettlement Action Plan (LAPRAP) or an Indigenous People's Action Plan, as applicable, which shall form part of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).<BR><BR>For projects undertaken through PPP schemes under RA No. 6957 (as amended), its IRR, and other pertinent laws, the provisions of the same shall govern the requirements for obtaining an ECC/CNC.<BR><BR><B>Section 14. RELOCATION OF INFORMAL SETTLERS</B><BR><BR>As provided in Section 9 of the Act, the government, through the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council (HUDCC) and the National Housing Authority (NHA), in coordination with the LGUs and IAs concerned, shall establish and develop resettlement sites for informal settlers, including the provision of adequate basic services and community facilities, in anticipation of informal settlers that have to be removed from the ROW or site of future infrastructure projects, pursuant to the provisions of the RA No. 7279. Whenever applicable, the concerned LGUs shall provide and administer the resettlement sites.<BR><BR>In case the expropriated land is occupied by informal settlers who are unable or refuse to demolish their structures and other improvements therein despite the writ of possession issued by the court under Section 7 of this IRR, the court shall issue the necessary writ of demolition for the purpose of dismantling any and all structures found within the subject property. The IA shall take into account and observe diligently the procedure provided for in Sections 28 and 29 of RA No. 7279.<BR><BR>Immediately after the project approval by the appropriate agency, the IA shall notify the HUDCC of its proposed project which may require the acquisition of ROW that may cause the displacement or relocation of informal settlers.<BR><BR><B>Section 15. APPROPRIATIONS</B><BR><BR>As provided in Section 10 of the Act, the government shall provide adequate appropriations that will allow the concerned IAs to acquire the required right-of-way, site or location for national government infrastructure projects in advance of the project implementation. These appropriations shall include the funds needed to cover the following expenses for activities directly related to right-of-way acquisition for the projects as provided in this Act: 
<OL type=a>
<LI>Cost of parcellary surveys and appraisal of properties affected by the projects;<BR><BR>
<LI>Compensation for the project-affected land, structures and improvements, including relocation or replacement of compensable utilities, crops and trees;<BR><BR>
<LI>Cost of development and implementation of resettlement projects covered by this Act, including planning, social preparation, in accordance with HUDCC design standards and costings. Where necessary, this may include land development and housing construction, provision of basic services and community facilities, livelihood restoration and improvement, and other activities under the resettlement action plan in coordination with concerned government agencies; and<BR><BR>
<LI>Related expenses of the IA, including CGT in the case of negotiated sale under Section 6 of this IRR, DST, transfer tax and registration fees for the transfer of titles, and other relevant administrative expenses for right-of-way management, including the cost of ECC application. </LI></OL>For PPP projects, the IA may, as part of the contract terms and conditions, require the project proponent to: 
<OL type=a>
<LI>advance the funds covering the cost of the ROW which shall be reimbursed later by the IA, except for unsolicited proposals; or<BR><BR>
<LI>finance the ROW cost for the government which shall be recovered partly or fully by the proponent from the tolls, fees, or tariffs to be charged to the users of the completed project. </LI></OL>For budgeting purposes, the ROW costs of projects without any benchmark prices may be based on the BIR zonal values times a factor not exceeding two (2).<BR><BR>For projects that have undergone pre-feasibility or feasibility study only, the proposed budget or appropriations for the replacement cost of affected structures or improvements may be based on benchmark unit costs which are derived from industry standards and accepted by the DPWH. An example of a benchmark unit cost is cost per square meter of floor area of a house or building.<BR><BR>For projects that have undergone detailed engineering design, the proposed budget or appropriations for the replacement cost of affected structures or improvements shall be based on detailed estimates, including bill of materials/quantities, in accordance with the standards and procedures set by the DPWH.<BR><BR><B>Section 16. DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN RIGHT-OF-WAY</B><BR><BR>As provided in Section 11 of the Act, upon the approval by the Head of the IA concerned of an infrastructure project with funding authorized in the General Appropriations Act and with defined ROW, no National Government Agency or LGU shall, within two years from date of notice of taking, allow within the said ROW any development or construction, or issue any building, construction, development or business permit, which is contrary to the approved plans and purposes of the project, unless explicitly authorized by the Head of the IA for justifiable reasons.<BR><BR>For this purpose, the date of notice of taking is the date of the letter issued by the IA to the concerned landowners, after the approval of the LAPRAP as part of the detailed engineering design, informing them of the intent of the IA to acquire their lands for the ROW.<BR><BR>Once the notice of taking is issued, any new structure or improvement to an existing one on the land covered by the notice shall not be compensated.<BR><BR>In the same manner, no informal settlers will be eligible for compensation if their structures are built after the cut-off date for entitlements. In this IRR, the "cut-off date" refers to the first day of census undertaken as part of LAPRAP preparation after both the project approval by the IA and Detailed Engineering Design.<BR><BR><B>Section 17.  RIGHT-OF-WAY SURVEY DOCUMENTS FOR ACQUIRED PROPERTIES</B><BR><BR>The IA shall submit the relevant documents indicating the survey limits for the lands acquired for ROW of infrastructure projects to the LGU concerned for information and reference in development planning, taxation, and other purposes.<BR><BR><B>Section 18.  AGENCY MANUAL OF PROCEDURES FOR ROW ACQUISITION</B><BR><BR>To provide clear, specific, and operational guidelines for the efficient acquisition of ROW for its infrastructure projects, each IA shall prepare and implement its own "Manual of Procedures for ROW Acquisition" (Manual).<BR><BR>Said Manual must be consistent with the provisions of the Act and this IRR and shall be customized to the particular requirements and systems for ROW acquisition of the IA. The IA Manual shall serve as the standard or uniform reference for the specific rules, processes, standard documents, and template forms to be used by the IA and its concerned central and field offices in the acquisition of ROW. The IA Manual shall also be used by property owners as their reference on the requirements and procedures to be followed to facilitate ROW acquisition, while ensuring that they obtain due process and fair compensation. Finally, the IA Manual shall serve as a guide for the GFIs and IPAs to be engaged by the IA in determining the appropriate price offers to property owners affected by ROW acquisition.<BR><BR>The IA Manual shall include the following basic content, as adapted with modifications from the DPWH Manual:<BR><BR>
