The grantee, with the approval of the Congress of the Philippines first had, may sell, lease, grant, convey, assign, give in usufruct, or transfer this franchise and all property and rights acquired thereunder to any individual, co-partnership, private, public or quasi-public association, corporation, or joint-stock company competent to operate the business hereby authorized, but transfer of title to the franchise or any right of ownership or interest acquired under such sale, lease, grant, conveyance, assignment, gift in usufruct, or transfer shall not be effective even after such approval shall have been obtained until there shall have been filed in the Office of the Public Service Commission or its legal successor an agreement in writing by which the individual, co-partnership, private, public, or quasi-public association, corporation, or joint-stock company in whose favor such sale, lease, grant, conveyance, assignment, gift in usufruct, or transfer is made, shall be firmly bound to comply with all the terms and conditions imposed upon the grantee by this franchise and by any and all certificates of convenience and public necessity therefor issued by the Public Service Commission or its legal successor, and to accept the same subject to all existing terms and conditions.<BR><BR>SEC. 8.

Against such declaration of forfeiture by the Public Service Commission or its legal successor, the grantee may apply for the remedies provided in Section thirty-four and thirty six of Commonwealth Act Numbered One hundred forty-six as amended.
