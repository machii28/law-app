He may take such action (1) whenever in his judgment such frequencies and wave lengths have been used, or there is danger that they will be used by the grantee to impair electrical communication, or stifle competition, or to obtain a monopoly in electrical communication or otherwise to violate the laws or public policy of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines; (2) whenever in his judgment the public interests of the Philippines requires that such frequencies or wave lengths should be used for other purposes than those of the grantee, either by the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, or by other individuals or corporations licensed by it; (3) whenever in his judgment for any reason the public interests of the Philippines so require. <BR><BR>SEC. 5. The radio stations of the grantee shall be so constructed and operated that a minimum of interference will result and the wave lengths selected with a view to avoiding interference with existing stations. <BR><BR>SEC. 6. A special right is reserved to the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, in time of war, insurrection, or domestic trouble, to take over and operate the said stations upon the order and direction of any authorized department of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines without compensating the grantee of the use of said stations during the period when they shall be so operated by the said Government. <BR><BR>SEC. 7. The grantee, its successors or assigns, shall not engage in domestic business of telecommunications in the Philippines without further special assent of the Congress of the Philippines, it being understood that the Purpose of this temporary permit is to secure to the grantee the right to construct, maintain and operate Private fixed point-to-point and private coastal radio stations in the places specified in this Act as the interest of the company and of its trade and business may require. <BR><BR>SEC. 8. No fees shall be charged by the grantee, as the radio stations that may be established by virtue of this Act shall engage in communications regarding the company's business only. <BR><BR>SEC. 9. The grantee, its successors or assigns, shall hold the National, provincial and municipal governments of the Republic of the Philippines harmless from all claims accounts, demands, or actions arising out of the accidents' or injuries whether to property or to persons, caused by the construction or operation of its radio stations. <BR><BR>SEC. 10. The grantee shall be subject to the corporation laws of the Philippines now existing or which may hereafter exist. <BR><BR>SEC. 11. This temporary permit shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress of the Philippines when the public interest so requires, and shall not be interpreted as an exclusive grant of the privileges herein provided for. <BR><BR>SEC. 12.
