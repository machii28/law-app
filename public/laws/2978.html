As a condition of the granting of this franchise, the grantee shall execute a bond in favor of the Government of the Philippines in the sum of fifty thousand pesos, in form and with sureties satisfactory to the Secretary of Public Works and Communications, conditioned upon the faithful performance of the grantees' obligations hereunder during the first three years of the life of this franchise.

When so accepted by the grantee and upon approval of the bond aforesaid by the Secretary of Public Works and Communications the grantee shall be empowered to exercise the privileges granted thereby.<BR><BR>SEC. 4.

In the event of any competing person, natural or juridical, receiving from the Congress a similar franchise in which there shall be any term or terms more favorable than those herein granted or tending to place the herein grantee at any disadvantage, then such term or terms shall ipso facto become a part of the terms hereof and shall operate equally in favor of the grantee as in the case of such competing person.<BR><BR>SEC. 6. (a) The grantee shall be liable to pay the same taxes on its real estate, buildings and personal property, exclusive of the franchise, as other persons, natural or juridical, are now or hereafter may be required by law to pay.<BR><BR>(b) The grantee shall further be liable to pay all other taxes that may be imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code by reason of this franchise.<BR><BR>SEC. 7.

A special right is hereby reserved to the President of the Philippines in time of war, rebellion, public peril or other national emergency and when public safety requires, to cause the closing of the grantee's radio station or stations or to authorize the use or possession thereof by any department of the government without compensation to the grantee for the use of said station during the continuance of the national emergency.<BR><BR>SEC. 11. The grantee shall not require any previous censorship of any speech, play, act or scene or other matter to be broadcast from its stations; but if any such speech, play, act or scene or other matters should constitute a violation of the law or infringement of a private right, the grantee shall be free from any liability, civil or criminal, for such speech, play, act or scene or other matters: <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Provided,</SPAN> That the grantee, during any broadcast, shall cut off from the air the speech, play, act or scene or other matters being broadcast, if the tendency thereof is to propose and/or incite treason, rebellion or sedition, or the language used therein or the theme thereof is indecent or immoral, and willful failure to do so shall constitute a valid cause for the cancellation of this franchise.<BR><BR>SEC. 12. The grantee shall not lease, transfer, grant the usufruct of, sell or assign this franchise nor the rights and privileges acquired thereunder to any person, natural or juridical, nor merge with any other person without the previous approval of the Congress of the Philippines. Any person, natural or juridical, to which this franchise is sold, transferred or assigned, shall be subject to all the conditions, terms, restrictions, and limitations of this franchise as fully and completely and to the same extent as if the franchise had been originally granted to such person.<BR><BR>SEC. 13.
