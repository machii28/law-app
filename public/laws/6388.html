If there are excess ballots they shall be replaced in the box and thoroughly mingled therein; and one of the members designated by the board, without seeing the ballots and with his back to the box, shall publicly draw out as many ballots as may be equal to such excess and, without unfolding them, place them in a package which shall be marked "EXCESS BALLOTS" and which shall be sealed and signed by the members of the board. The package shall be placed in the compartment for valid votes, but its contents shall not be read in the counting of votes. If, in the course of the examination, any ballots shall be found folded together before they were deposited in the box, they shall be placed in the package for excess ballots. In case ballots with their detachable numbers be found in the box, such numbers shall be removed and deposited in the compartment for spoiled ballots, and, if ballots with the words "spoiled" be found in the box, such ballot shall likewise be placed in the compartment for spoiled ballots.<BR><BR>SEC. 186. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Marked ballots.</SPAN>—The board of inspectors shall then unfold the ballots and determine whether there are any marked ballots, and, if any be found, they shall be placed in a package labeled "MARKED BALLOTS" which shall be sealed and signed by the members of the board and placed in the compartment for valid ballots, and shall not be counted. A majority vote of the board shall be sufficient to determine whether any ballot is marked or not. Non-official ballots which the board may find, except those which have been used as emergency ballots, shall be counted as marked ballots.<BR><BR>SEC. 187. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Compartment for spoiled ballots.</SPAN>—The ballots deposited in the compartment for spoiled ballots shall be presumed to be spoiled ballots, whether or not they contain such notation; but, if the board of inspectors shall find that during the voting any valid ballot has by mistake been placed in this compartment or any ballot separated as excess or marked has been erroneously placed therein and not in the proper package, the board shall open said compartment after the voting and before the counting of votes for the sole purpose of drawing out the ballots erroneously placed therein. It shall then prepare and sign a statement of such fact and lock the box with its three keys immediately thereafter. The valid ballots so withdrawn shall be mixed with the other valid ballots, and the excess or marked ballots shall be placed in their proper packages, which shall for such purpose be opened and again labelled, sealed, signed and kept as hereinbefore provided.<BR><BR>SEC. 188. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Manner of counting votes</SPAN>.—The counting of votes shall be made in the following manner: the board shall form separate piles of one hundred ballots fully extended, which shall be held together with rubber bands, with cardboards of the size of the ballots to serve as folders. The chairman of the board shall take the ballots of the first pile one by one and read the names of the persons voted and the offices for which they were voted in the order in which they appear thereon, assuming such a position as to enable the two party inspectors and all or at least a majority of the watchers to read such names. One teacher-inspector shall record on the tally board as the names voted for each office are read, the number of votes received by each candidate, each vote being recorded by a vertical line, except every fifth vote of the same candidate which shall be recorded by a diagonal line crossing the previous four vertical lines. The poll clerk shall do likewise on the election returns as prescribed in Section one hundred ninety hereof. After finishing the first pile of ballots, the board shall determine the total number of the votes recorded for each candidate, the sum being noted on the tally sheet and on the election returns. In case of discrepancy such recount as may be necessary shall be made. The ballots shall then be grouped together again as before the reading. Thereafter, the same procedure shall be followed with the second pile of ballots and so on successively. After all the votes of the precinct have been counted the board shall sum up the totals recorded for each candidate, and the aggregate sum shall be likewise recorded on the tally sheet and on the election returns. It shall then place each pile of ballots in an envelope prepared for the purpose, and each envelope shall be closed, signed, and deposited in the compartment for valid ballots. The tally sheet on which the votes have been recorded and wherein the partial and total sums appear shall not be changed or destroyed but shall be kept in the compartment for valid ballots.<BR><BR>SEC. 189. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Rules for the appreciation of ballots.</SPAN>—In the reading and appreciation of ballots, the board of election inspectors shall observe the following rules:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Where only the Christian name of a candidate or only his surname is written, the vote for such candidate is Valid, if there is no other candidate with the same name or surname for the same office.
<LI>When on the ballot is written a single word which is the Christian name of a candidate and which is at the same time the surname of his opponent, the vote shall be counted in favor of the latter.
<LI>When two words are written on the ballot, one of which is the Christian name of the candidate and the other is the surname of his opponent, the vote shall not be counted for either.
<LI>A name or surname incorrectly written which, when read, has a sound similar to that name or surname of a candidate when correctly written shall be counted in his favor.
<LI>When the name of a candidate appears in a space of the ballot for an office for which he is a candidate and in another space for which he is not a candidate, it shall be counted in his favor for the office of which he is a candidate and the vote for the office of which he is not a candidate shall be considered as stray, except when it is used as a means to identify the voter, in which case the whole ballot is invalid.
<LI>When in a space in the ballot there appears a name of a candidate that is erased and another clearly written, the vote is valid for the latter.
<LI>Ballots which contain prefixes such as "Sr.", "Mr/', "Datu", "don", "ginoo", "Hon.", "Gob.", or suffixes like "hijo", "Jr.", "segundo" are valid.
<LI>The erroneous initial of the name which accompanies the correct surname of a candidate, the erroneous initial of the surname accompanying the correct name of a candidate, or the erroneous intermediate initial between the correct name and surname of a candidate does not annul the vote in favor of the latter.
<LI>The fact that there exists another person who is not a candidate with the name or surname of a candidate does not prevent the adjudication of the vote to the latter.
<LI>Ballots wholly written in Arabic in localities where it is of general use are valid. To read them the board may employ any person who upon oath can do so impartially.
<LI>The use of nicknames and appellations of affection and friendship, if accompanied by the name or surname of the candidate, does not annul such vote, except when they were used as a means to identify their respective voters, in which case the whole ballot is invalid: <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Provided,</SPAN> That if a nickname is used unaccompanied by the name or surname of a candidate and it is one by which he is generally or popularly known in the locality and stated in his certificate of candidacy, the same shall be counted in favor of said candidate, if there is no other candidate for the same office with the same nickname.
<LI>Any ballot written with crayon, lead pencil, ball pen, or with ink, wholly or in part, is valid.
<LI>Where there are two or more candidates voted for an office for which the law authorizes the election of only one person, the ballot shall not be counted in favor of any of them, but this shall not affect the validity of the other votes contained therein.
<LI>If the candidates voted for senators, for councilors or for other offices for which the election of two or more candidates is required exceed the number to be elected, the ballot is valid, but the votes shall be counted only in favor of the candidates whose names were firstly written by the voter within the spaces provided for said office in the ballot until the authorized number is covered.
<LI>Any vote in favor of a person who has not filed a certificate of candidacy or in favor of a candidate for any office for which he did not present himself shall be void and counted as a stray vote but; shall not invalidate the whole ballot.

<LI>Any vote containing initials only or which is illegible or which does not sufficiently identify the candidate for whom it is intended shall not be valid, but this shall not invalidate the whole ballot.
<LI>When there are two or more candidates for the same office with the same name or surname, the voter shall, in order that his vote may be counted, add the correct name, surname or initial that will identify the candidate for whom he votes. But, if a candidate has been elected with that name or surname in the immediately preceding election to the same office, a vote with that name or surname alone shall be counted for him,
<LI>Circles, crosses or lines put on the spaces on which the voter has not voted shall be considered as signs to indicate his desistance from voting and shall not invalidate the ballot.
<LI>Unless it should clearly appear that they have been deliberately put by the voter to serve as identification marks, commas, dots, lines, or hyphens between the name and surname of a candidate, or in other parts of the ballots, traces of the letters "t", "j", and other similar ones, the first letters or syllables of names which the voter does not continue, the use of two or more kinds of writing and unintentional or accidental flourishes, strokes, or stains, shall not invalidate the ballot.
<LI>The accidental tearing or perforation of a ballot does not annul it.
<LI>Failure to remove the detachable number from a ballot does not annul such ballot.
<LI>Any ballot which clearly appears to have been filled by two distinct persons before it was deposited in the ballot box during the voting is totally null and void.
<LI>Any vote cast in favor of a candidate for an elective position who has been disqualified under this Code shall be considered as stray and shall not be counted but shall not invalidate the ballot.
<LI>If on the ballot is correctly written the name of a candidate but with a different surname, or is correctly written the surname of the candidate but with different name, the vote shall not be counted in favor of any candidate having such name and/or surname but the ballot shall be considered valid for other candidates.</LI></OL>SEC. 190. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Statement of the count</SPAN>—The board of inspectors shall prepare the statement of the count, commonly known as the election returns, simultaneously with the counting of the votes as prescribed in Section one hundred eighty-eight hereof.
