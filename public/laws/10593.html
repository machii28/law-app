<P>“(d) When the tree is severely damaged by typhoon or lightning; </P>
<P>“(e) When the agricultural land devoted to coconut production shall have been converted in accordance with law into residential, commercial or industrial areas; </P>
<P>“(f) When the land devoted to coconut production shall be converted into other agricultural uses or other agriculture-related activities in pursuance to a conversion duly applied for by the owner and approved by the proper authorities: <EM>Provided, </EM>That no conversion shall be allowed by the PCA until after it shall have been verified and certified that for a period of at least three (3) years the majority of the coconut trees have become senescent and economically unproductive or where the coconut farm is not adaptable to sound management practices on account of geographical location, topography, drainage and other conditions rendering the farm economically unproductive; and </P>
<P>“(g) When the tree would cause hazard to life and property. </P>
<P>“No other causes other than those abovementioned shall be considered as a valid ground for cutting.” </P>
<P>SEC. 2. Section 5 of Republic Act No. 8048 is hereby amended to read as follows: </P>
<P>“SEC. 5. <EM>Permit to Cut.</EM> – No coconut tree or trees shall be cut unless a permit therefore, upon due application being made, has been issued by the PCA pursuant to Section 6 of this Act. </P>
<P>“The applicant shall pay an application fee in the amount of One hundred pesos (P100.00) for every tree intended to be cut payable to the PCA. Forty pesos (P40.00) of the fee shall accrue in favor of the PCA, Forty pesos (P40.00) in favor of the municipal government concerned, and Twenty pesos (P20.00) in favor of the barangay unit concerned. The fees allocated to the PCA shall be used for its replanting program and the fees allocated to the municipal/city government shall be used for the repair and rehabilitation of roads of the respective local government units which have been damaged by the continuous passage of heavy vehicles used for transporting coconut lumber. </P>
<P>“Fees herein collected shall be deposited with the nearest Land Bank of the Philippines branch or other government depository banks. Fees accruing to the local government unit shall be remitted within three (3) months in accordance with existing Commission on Audit (COA) rules and regulations. </P>

<P>“Such replanting, however, shall not apply to areas converted into industrial, commercial or residential sites or land transformed in accordance with law, into other agricultural purposes. </P>
<P>“The PCA, in coordination with the local government unit concerned, shall verify if a replanting was implemented and regulate and oversee the fertilization and care of the newly planted coconut trees. For this purpose, it shall be incumbent upon the PCA to conduct, from time to time, on-the-spot inspections of the sites where the coconut trees have been planted.” </P>

<P>“The PCA, in order to effectively implement the provisions of this Act, may request the assistance of any local government unit, to monitor and ensure compliance with this Act including its implementing rules and regulations. For this purpose, the PCA may deputize the Philippine National Police or other law enforcement agencies to investigate and apprehend those caught violating the provisions of this Act, including the confiscation of illegally cut coconut trees. In order to prevent wastage, the PCA shall order the immediate disposition of confiscated coconut lumber in a manner to be determined by the PCA. </P>
<P>“In addition to the foregoing, the PCA shall also, in coordination, with the local government unit concerned, require the registration of all sawmills, lumberyards, coconut wood dealers and other persons or entities dealing in the processing and sawing of coconut trees.” </P>

<P>“If the offender is a corporation or a juridical entity, the official who ordered, or allowed the commission of the offense shall be punished with the same penalty. </P>
<P>“If the offender is in the government service, he shall, in addition be dismissed from office. </P>
