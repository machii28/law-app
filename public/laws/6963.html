Any person who unduly delays, refuses or in any manner prevents the payment of the special financial assistance defined in this Act to the person or persons entitled thereto shall be dismissed from office if found guilty in an appropriate administrative case.<BR><BR>SEC. 12. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prejudice and diminish whatever benefits a member of the military establishment or the Integrated National Police is entitled to receive under existing laws.<BR><BR>SEC. 13.
