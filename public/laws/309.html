Every license issued shall specify the person, race-track, racing club, or entity to which the same is issued, the place, enclosure or track where the races are to be held, and the days upon which the same will be permitted. Such license may be suspended or revoked by the Commission on Races for any just cause.<BR><BR>SEC. 4. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Racing days.</SPAN>—Private individuals and entities duly licensed by the Commission on Races may hold horse races on Sundays not reserved under this Act, on twenty-four Saturdays as may be determined by the said Commission, and on legal holidays except Thursday and Friday of Holy Week, July fourth, commonly known as Independence Day, and December thirtieth, commonly known as Rizal Day.

Such license shall be obtained from the Commission yearly and shall, however, be subject to withdrawal or revocation in any case where the Commission shall have reason to believe that any of the aforesaid persons is incompetent, or is guilty of any dishonest or fraudulent practice, or has violated any law, rule or regulation on horse-racing. Charitable, relief, or civic organizations authorized to hold races may employ their own personnel to manage said races.<BR><BR>SEC. 6. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Record of tickets sold.</SPAN>—No person, race-track, racing club, nor any other entity holding horse-races the crossings of which on any race day exceed fifty thousand pesos, shall be allowed to hold races, unless such person, race-track, racing club, or entity is provided with an automatic, electrically-operated public indicator system and ticket-selling machines, by means of which every ticket purchased on every horse in any race, shall be automatically and instantaneously recorded by electrical impulse on a prominently-displayed bulletin board, each figure, letter, or symbol of which shall be readable from a distance. However, any such person, race-track, racing club, or entity may, upon proper application, be provisionally licensed by the Commission on Races to hold horse-races even without the required automatic electric totalizator: <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Provided,</SPAN> That it shall provide itself with mechanical or other deuces by which every ticket purchased on every horse in any race shall be recorded on a prominently displayed bulletin board readable from a distance in lieu of the required automatic electric totalizator which shall be subject to the approval of the Commission on Races after they have been tested and found by the Commission to be satisfactory: <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">And</SPAN> <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">provided, further,</SPAN> That such person, race-track, racing club, or entity shall acquire and install within its premises the required automatic electric totalizator within such period as may be determined by the Commission but not beyond June thirty, nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and failure to comply with this requirement shall cause the cancellation of their respective licenses.<BR><BR>SEC. 7. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Official starters</SPAN>.—Every person, race-track, racing club, or any other entity holding horse-racing shall appoint official starters for the races. The stewards of the day shall designate a starter from among those appointed by the club to officiate in each race.<BR><BR>SEC. 8. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Stewards and fudges.</SPAN>—There shall be at least three stewards on each racing day, who may also act as the judges of finish. They shall have the necessary powers to supervise the conduct of the races, and to enforce the rules and regulations applicable on all questions and matters arising during the racing day. It shall be their duty to determine and decide the win, place, and show horses in each race; to render the decision in all events in the order the winning horses shall have crossed the tape line, and in case of closely contested events as shown by the photo-finish picture, which in all such cases shall be taken, to apply and to enforce the penalties provided against offending jockeys, trainers, horse owners, track employees, or other persons, who in any way perform duties connected with the races; and to perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the Commission on Races.<BR><BR>SEC. 9. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Handicappers.</SPAN>—Every person, race-track, racing club, or any other entity holding horse-races shall employ at least one handicapper. It shall be the duty of the handicappers to keep a complete and up-to-date record of all registered horses, their owners, color, height, and such other characteristics as will aid in their proper identification, the particular group or class to which each horse belongs, together with the weight each carried in the previous races participated in. The handicappers shall prepare the program of races in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Commission on Races may prescribe. Such program shall, however, be subject to the approval of the said Commission before it can be published as the official program of the person, race-track, racing club, or entity concerned.<BR><BR>SEC. 10.<SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic"> Field inspectors.</SPAN>—The Commission on Races shall appoint the necessary field inspectors to watch the events during each racing-day. They shall be assigned at various places throughout the race-track. It shall be their duty to carefully observe and detect anomalies and irregularities of any nature that may be committed during the progress of a race, or at the starting or finishing of a race; and to detect any fraudulent or dishonest deals, transactions or acts that may be committed in the race tracks. They shall report immediately any such anomalies, irregularities or fraudulent or dishonest acts, which they may discover to the stewards of the day, who shall promptly take such action as the circumstances may warrant. Their salaries or compensation shall be fixed by the Commission subject to the approval of the President of the Philippines.<BR><BR>SEC. 11. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Track auditors and checkers.</SPAN>—For the purpose of supervising and verifying the accuracy of reports of any person, race-track, racing club, or any other entity holding races, with respect to the totalizator receipts or the total amount of wager made on each racing event, the dividends awarded for winning horses, whether win, place, or show on each event, and other matters referring the financial computations or statements, the Commission on Races shall appoint such number of auditing officers and checkers as may be necessary to be placed in the offices and tracks of the person, race-track, racing club, or entity concerned. It shall be the duty of said auditing officers and checkers to report to the Commission any irregularities or erroneous computations, which they may discover in connection with reports on the totalizator sales or the total sales of wager tickets, or the dividends awarded on each racing event. Their salaries or rate of compensation shall be fixed by the Commission, subject to the approval of the President of the Philippines.<BR><BR>SEC. 12. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Jockeys.</SPAN>—No person, race-track, racing club, nor any other entity holding horse-racing shall allow a person to ride as jockey, unless such person possesses the qualifications to be prescribed by the Commission on Races. The Commission may, however, permit gentlemen or lady riders without license in special events.<BR><BR>SEC. 13. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Quartering of jockeys.</SPAN>—Before the start of the races in any day, all the jockeys that are registered to ride during that day, shall be quartered in an assigned enclosure of the race-track apart from the public. They shall not be allowed to communicate with any person or persons in the race-tracks, except with authorized officials or representatives of the person, race-track, racing club, or any other entity holding horse-racing concerned or the officials of the Commission on Races. They shall be allowed to come out of the enclosure only at the time of riding in a race, and shall be kept there until after they have run their last race of the day.<BR><BR>SEC. 14. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Entries.</SPAN>—When two or more horses belonging to one owner or are trained or cared for in one stable are entered in the same race, such horses shall be considered as an "entry" only and paired in the betting as one horse, so that if any of the said horses wins, the holders of the tickets for the "entry" shall be entitled to the dividends. No horse may participate in a race unless it carries a number and tickets are offered for sale on such a horse. The handicappers at their discretion may group two or more horses participating in a race in a "field" when such horses belong to different owners or are cared for or trained in different stables. Such horses shall be grouped in the betting as one and when any of such horses wins, all holders of the "field" tickets shall be paid the dividends corresponding to the "field."<BR><BR>SEC. 15. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Betting.</SPAN>—The face-value of totalizator tickets for wager may be one peso, two pesos or five pesos, whether for win, place, or show. The face-value of said tickets, as the case may be, shall be the basis for the computation of dividends, and such dividends shall be paid after eliminating fractions of ten centavos: for example, if the resulting dividend is ten pesos and ninety-eight centavos, the dividend that shall be paid will be only ten pesos and ninety centavos. If no ticket has been sold on a winning horse, whether for win, place or show, the dividends corresponding to such race shall be paid out to the holders of tickets sold on the horses that finished dead heat, or on the horse that finished next to that on which not a single ticket was sold: <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Provided,</SPAN> That the owner of said winning horse shall be entitled to the corresponding stake or prize.<BR><BR>SEC. 16. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Daily-double races.</SPAN>—Every person, race-track, racing club or any other entity holding horse-racing may hold daily-double events as may be authorized by the Commission on Races pursuant to the rules and regulations prescribed by said Commission.<BR><BR>SEC. 17. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Announcement in daily-double races.</SPAN>—Before starting the first race of a daily-double event, the person, race-track, racing club, or any other entity holding the races shall announce through loud-speakers, the names of jockeys mounting each horse, the weights on each horse, the number of tickets sold on each horse, and the total number of tickets sold on the race. The same process shall be repeated before starting the second race of a daily-double event, except that in this case, the number of tickets sold on each horse of the second race, coupled with the winning horse of the first race, shall be announced, instead of the tickets sold on each horse of the second race. The person, race-track, racing club, or any other entity holding a daily-double race shall submit to the auditors of the Commission on Races the stubs of tickets sold and such other information on the betting as may be required for verification.<BR><BR>SEC. 18. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Hour of running daily-double races; posting of ticket sales.</SPAN>—The time for the running of the first race of any daily-double event shall be determined by the Commission on Races depending upon the circumstances surrounding each racing-day which shall be announced to the public by the person, race-track, racing club, or entity holding the races through loud-speakers at the time of the selection of the races constituting the daily-double event, and the second race thereof shall be run not later than forty-five minutes after the first race. The sale of tickets for the daily-double races shall be allowed after the Commission on Races or its authorized representatives has announced to the public the two races constituting each daily-double event. The number of tickets sold on each horse in the two races of each daily-double event and the totals thereof shall be posted at conspicuous bulletin boards. This information shall also be given to the public through loud-speakers. The closing of the sale of tickets for each event shall be properly announced by the ringing of a bell after which no more tickets shall be sold.<BR><BR>SEC. 19. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Distribution of receipts.</SPAN>—The total wager funds or gross receipts from the sale of<SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic"> pari-mutuel</SPAN> tickets shall be apportioned as follows: eighty-seven and one half <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">per centum</SPAN> shall be distributed in the form of dividends among holders of win, place and show horses, as the case may be, in the regular races; twelve and one-half <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">per centum </SPAN>shall be set aside as the commission of the person, race-track, racing club, or any other entity conducting the races, which shall include the amounts for the payment of authorized stakes or prizes for win, place and show horses, and authorized bonuses for jockeys; and in the case of daily-double races, the gross receipts derived from the total sale of daily-double tickets shall be apportioned in the same manner as provided hereinabove, except that the eighty-seven and one-half <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">per centum</SPAN> of the gross receipts from the total sale of daily-double tickets shall be distributed in the form of dividends among the holders of the winning combination of horses, that is, the two horses that won first place in the two races, instead of among holders of win, place and show horses, as in the case of regular races: <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Provided however,</SPAN> That of the twelve and one-half <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">per centum</SPAN> representing the commission of the person, race-track, racing club, or any other entity holding horse-racing an amount equivalent to one-half <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">per centum</SPAN> of the total wager funds or gross receipts from the sale of tickets shall be set aside and turned over by the person, race-track, racing club, or any other entity holding horse-racing as a special fund to the Commission on Races to cover its expenses and such other purposes authorized under this Act.
