In no case, however, may this margin of contingencies be more than ten per cent of the cost of the work nor the allowance for profit be more than ten per cent. For work being undertaken by administration, the engineer concerned may, however, be allowed to submit a revised program of work before the completion of the project if, due to unforeseen rise in price of materials or to changes in field conditions or to other such circumstance, it becomes evident that the allowance for contingencies is not sufficient to absorb the increase and, therefore, he cannot successfully accomplish the work according to his original program. With the exception of projects the estimated cost of any of which is ten thousand pesos or less, under no circumstance shall the District or City or Project Engineer start work without first securing approval of the corresponding program of work from the Head of the Bureau or Office concerned or from the latter's duly designated representative, and no program of work for any project which requires special site investigation, survey and construction plans shall be approved unless such plans are used as basis of the program.

After evaluating the offer and the terms proposed by comparing them with the corresponding program of work and estimate, the project may be awarded by the official concerned to the applicant through a negotiated contract for an amount not to exceed ninety percent of the cost of the work as originally estimated and programmed pursuant to section four of this act.
