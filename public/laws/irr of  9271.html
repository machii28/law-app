This includes the implementation of the International Health Regulations (IHR) of the World Health Organization (WHO) in which the country is bound to observe and implement as a member state of said organization.<BR><BR>The Bureau of Quarantine, being the health authority, is mandated to ensure security against the introduction and spread of infectious diseases to include the emerging diseases and public health emergencies of international concern. This include a pro-active response to public health concerns on matters pertaining to food safety, sanitation and vector control in airports and seaports of entry on conveyances, people, goods and cargoes.<BR><BR>The updated regulations are devised to respond to the epidemiological changes and continuing global trends which markedly have an impact on disease surveillance, prevention and control. The promotion of these health regulations are balanced by an equal concern on the minimal interference with travel and trade and to meet the standards and requisites for quarantine operations involving both the international and domestic interests.<BR><BR>
