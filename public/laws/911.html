Any offense against the provisions of this section shall be a misdemeanor and be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand pesos, or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, in the discretion of the court, and such offender shall also be dismissed from office or discharged from employment. <BR><BR>SEC. 18. The Commission shall make a thorough study of the tariff system of the Philippines, and not later than one and one half years from the date of assumption of office of its members, shall submit its recommendations for a revision of the tariff system together with a draft of a bill embodying a revised tariff law. <BR><BR>SEC. 19. Upon request of the President, or upon resolution of either or both Houses of Congress, or upon its own motion, or when in the judgment of the Commission there is good and sufficient reason therefor, upon application of any interested party, the Commission shall investigate the differences in the costs of production of domestic article and of any like or similar foreign article. In the course of the investigation the Commission shall hold hearings and give reasonable public notice thereof, and shall afford reasonable opportunity for parties interested to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard at such hearings. The Commission is authorized to adopt such reasonable procedure and rules and regulations as it deems necessary to execute its functions under this Act. The Commission shall report to the President the results of the investigation and its findings with respect to such differences in costs of production. If the Commission finds it shown by the investigation that the duties expressly fixed by existing law do not equalize the differences in the costs of production of the domestic article and the like or similar foreign article when produced in the principal competing country, the Commission shall specify in its report such increases or decreases in rates of duty expressly fixed by existing law (including any necessary changes in classification) as it finds shown by the investigation to be necessary to equalize such differences. <BR><BR>SEC. 20. If the Commission finds upon any such investigation that such differences cannot be equalized by proceeding as hereinbefore provided, it shall so state in its report to the President and shall specify therein such <EM>ad valorem</EM> rates of duty based upon the Philippines selling price (as hereinafter defined) as it finds shown by the investigation to be necessary to equalize such differences. <BR><BR>The Philippine selling price of any article manufactured or produced in the Philippines shall be the price, including the cost of all containers and coverings of whatever nature and all other costs, charges, and expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition packed ready for delivery, at which such article is freely offered for sale for domestic consumption to all purchasers in the principal market of the Philippines, in the ordinary course of trade and in the usual wholesale quantities in such market, or the price that the manufacturer, producer, or owner would have received or was willing to receive for such merchandise when sold for domestic consumption in the ordinary of trade and in the usual wholesale quantities at the time of exportation of the imported article. <BR><BR>The President shall recommend to Congress the rates of duty and changes in classification and in basis of value specified in any report of the Commission under this Act, if in his judgment such rates of duty and changes are shown by such investigation of the Commission to be necessary to equalize such differences in cost of production. <BR><BR>SEC. 21. In ascertaining the differences in costs of production, the Commission shall take into consideration, in so far as it finds practicable:<BR>
<OL type=a>
<LI>In the case of a domestic article, the cost of production as hereinafter in this Act defined; transportation costs and other costs incident to delivery to the principal market or markets of the Philippines for the article; and other relevant factors that constitute an advantage or disadvantage in competition. <BR>
<LI>In the case of a foreign article, the cost of production as hereinafter in this Act defined, or if the Commission finds that such cost is not readily ascertainable, the Commission may accept as evidence thereof, or as supplemental thereto, the weighted average of the invoice prices or values for a representative period and for the average wholesale selling price for a representative period (which price shall be that at which the article is freely offered for sale to all purchasers in the principal market or markets of the principal competing country or countries in, the ordinary course of trade and in the usual wholesale quantities in such market or markets); transportation costs and other costs incident to delivery to the principal market or markets of the Philippines for the article; other relevant factors that constitute an advantage or disadvantage in competition, including advantages granted to foreign producers by a government, person, partnership, corporation, or association in a foreign country.<BR></LI></OL>SEC. 22.

The Secretary of Finance is authorized to make such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary for the entry and declaration of foreign articles of the class or kind of articles with respect to which a change in basis of value has been made under the provisions of section twenty of this Act, and for the form of invoice required at time of entry.<BR><BR>SEC. 24. There is hereby appropriated the sum of three hundred thousand pesos with which to meet the expenses of the Commission created under this Act. <BR><BR>SEC. 25.
