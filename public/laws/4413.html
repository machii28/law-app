But, if the realty is not thus redeemed within a year, the forfeiture shall become absolute and the city treasurer shall execute a deed, similar in form and having the same effect as the deed required to be made by him in case of a sale, conveying the real estate to the city. The deed shall be recorded as required by law for other real estate titles and shall then be forwarded to the Mayor for notation and return to the city treasurer who shall file the same and enter it in his records of city property.<BR><BR>SEC. 58. <EM>Repurchase by owner after absolute forfeiture</EM>.—After the title to the property shall have become absolutely vested in the Government of the City of Rajah Buayan in the manner above provided, and at any time before a sale or contract of sale shall have been made by the city treasurer to a third party in the manner provided for by law, the original owner or his legal representative shall have a further right to repurchase the property in question by paying therefor the full amount then due for taxes, penalties, and costs, together with an additional penalty of fifteen <EM>per centum</EM> upon the whole, and if the City Mayor has made a contract for the lease of the property the repurchase may be made subject to such contract. <BR><BR>SEC. 59. <EM>Civil action to collect tax debt</EM>.—The assessment of a tax shall constitute a lawful indebtedness of the taxpayer to the city which may be enforced by a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction, and this remedy shall be in addition to all the other remedies provided by law. <BR><BR>SEC. 60. <EM>Suits assailing validity of tax</EM>.—No court shall entertain any suit assailing the validity of a tax assessed under this Article until the taxpayer shall have paid, under protest, the taxes assessed against him, nor shall any court declare any tax invalid by reason of irregularities or informalities in the proceedings of the officers charged with the assessment or collection of the taxes, or of a failure to perform their duties within the time herein specified for their performance, unless such irregularities, informalities, or failures shall have impaired the substantial rights of the taxpayer; nor shall any court declare any tax assessed under the provisions of this Article invalid except upon condition that the taxpayer shall pay the just amount of his tax as determined by the court in the pending proceeding. <BR><BR>SEC. 61. <EM>Suits assailing validity of tax sale</EM>.—No court shall entertain any suit assailing the validity of a tax sale of real estate under this Article until the taxpayer shall have paid into the court the amount for which the real estate was sold, together with the interest at the rate of fifteen <EM>per centum per annum</EM> upon the sum from the date of sale to the time of instituting the suit. The money so paid into court shall belong to the purchaser at the tax sale if the deed is declared invalid, and shall be returned to the depositor should he fail in his action. Nor shall any court declare any such sale invalid by reason of any irregularities or informalities in the proceedings of the officer charged with the duty of making the sale or by reason of failure by him to perform his duties within the time herein specified for their performance, unless such irregularities, informalities, or failures shall have impaired the substantial rights of the taxpayer. <BR><BR>SEC. 62. <EM>Application of proceeds of real estate tax</EM>.—Eighty <EM>per centum</EM> of the gross proceeds from the real estate tax herein provided shall accrue to the general fund of the city, ten <EM>per centum</EM> thereof shall, any provision of existing law to the contrary notwithstanding, accrue to its streets and bridges fund, and the remaining ten <EM>per centum</EM> shall be retained by and/or for the corresponding barrio in accordance with the provisions of Republic Act Numbered Thirty-five hundred and ninety. The portion accruing to the latter fund shall be used exclusively for the repair, maintenance, improvement, and/or construction of city streets and bridges.<BR>
