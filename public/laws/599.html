Thereafter the same procedure shall be followed with the second pile of ballots and so on successively. After all the votes of the precinct have been counted the board shall sum up the totals recorded for each candidate, and the aggregate sum shall be likewise recorded on the tally sheet and on the blackboard. It shall then place each pile of ballots in an envelope prepared for the purpose, and each envelope shall be closed, signed, and deposited in the box for valid ballots. The tally sheet on which the votes have been recorded and wherein the partial and total sums appear shall not be changed or destroyed but shall be kept in the box for valid ballots."<BR><BR>"SEC. 150. <EM>Statement of the count.</EM>-Immediately after the count, the board of inspectors shall make, complete and sign a written statement thereof in quadruplicate.
