In the discretion of the board of directors a loan may be repaid by the surrender of pledged shares whose withdrawal value equals the amount loaned and all interest and fines due thereon.<BR><BR>SEC. 51. The rates of interest on loans may be fixed in the by-laws or may be prescribed from time to time by board of directors, subject to the provisions of the Usury Law and to any regulations which the Monetary Board may issue with respect thereto.<BR><BR>SEC. 52. Whenever a borrowing stockholder shall be three months in arrears in the payment of his due on stock or in the interest or premium or installments of premium on any loan, the whole loan, at the option of board of directors, shall become due and payable and the board may proceed by action to enforce collection upon the securities held by the association.  The withdrawal value of all shares pledged as collateral security at the time of the commencement of the action shall be applied to the payment of the loan, and such shares from the time of such application shall be deemed to be surrendered to the association.<BR><BR>SEC. 53. Mutual building and loan associations may purchase, hold, and convey real estate under the same conditions as those specified with reference to commercial banks in section twenty-five of this Act.<BR><BR>SEC. 54. Stockholders may surrender their shares and withdraw from the association after paying twelve monthly installments of dues upon giving sixty days notice in writing to the board of directors, and the withdrawal value of such shares shall be the total sum of the dues paid thereon plus not less than ninety per cent of all dividends earned by such shares up to the end of the last preceding fiscal period plus such interest for the time elapsed since the end of that period as shall be allowed by the board of directors. Stockholders who have not paid twelve monthly installments of dues may, after giving sixty days notice in writing to the board of directors, surrender their shares and withdraw from the association, and the withdrawal value of such shares shall be the total sum of the dues paid thereon plus such dividend or interest as may be allowed by the board of directors. In no event, however, shall more than one-third of the total receipts of the association be paid in any one month to retire such shares.  Payment for such surrendered shares shall be made in the order in which notices of withdrawal have been received by the board of directors: <EM>Provided</EM>, That should the business of the association during the period such withdrawing member has been a stockholder show a loss in excess of the reserve available for meeting such loss, the withdrawal value of such shares shall be charged with their proportion of such loss: <EM>And provided, finally</EM>, That any fines or charges lawfully chargeable against such shares may be deducted before making payment to the stockholder.  Except in cases of voluntary or forced liquidation of a building and loan association or forfeitures as provided in section forty-six of this Act, the board of directors of such association shall not have power to force the surrender and withdrawal of unmatured shares.<BR><BR>SEC. 55. At least once a year the profits on all business transacted shall be determined by the board of directors and apportioned to all the shares in each series outstanding at the time of such apportionment on the basis of the actual value of such shares, as distinguished from their withdrawal value, but in determining the profits which may be so apportioned, there shall be deducted from the gross earnings of the association all expenses and losses incurred in conducting its business. Five per cent (5%) of the net earnings shall be credited to a reserved account until the reserve equals five per cent (5%) of the total assets of the association. The reserve shall be maintained at five per cent (5%) of the total assets and shall be available for meeting losses incurred by the association.  The remainder of the net earnings shall be available for apportionment among the stockholders. In the event of the liquidation of a building and loan association there shall escheat to the State any part of the reserve remaining after charging off all losses and defraying all expenses of liquidation.<BR><BR>

Property deposited with any trust company in conformity with this section shall be held by said company under the orders and direction of the court.<BR><BR>SEC. 61.

The lending or investment of deposits or moneys received by any trust company as executor of the will of any deceased person or as administrator, with or without the will annexed, or as guardian, receiver, trustee, or depositary of the estate of any minor, insane person, idiot, habitual drunkard, or other incompetent or irresponsible person, or as receiver or depositary under and by virtue of any order or appointment of any court, or as trustee under any instrument in writing constituting the company a trustee, unless otherwise directed by the instrument creating the trust, shall be limited to the loans and investments enumerated in section thirty-one of Chapter V (Savings and Mortgage Banks).

The capital stock and funds of a trust company may be loaned or otherwise invested as its by-laws prescribe; if it does a commercial banking business in addition to its trust business, the investment of its funds other than trust funds shall be governed by the relevant provisions of Chapter IV of this Act.<BR>Real estate acquired by a trust company, in whatever manner and for whatever purpose, shall likewise be governed by the relevant provisions of section twenty-five of this Act.<BR><BR>SEC. 65. As security for the faithful performance of its trust duties, every trust company, before transacting trust business, shall carry on deposit with the Central Bank of the Philippines, cash or securities approved by the Monetary Board in an amount equal to not less than two hundred and fifty thousand pesos: <EM>Provided, however</EM>, That the Monetary Board shall require any trust company to increase the amount of its securities on deposit with the Central Bank whenever in the judgment of the Monetary Board such increase is necessary by reason of the growth of the trust business of the company: <EM>And provided, further</EM>, That the paid-in capital and surplus of the company must be at least equal to the amount required to be deposited with the Central Bank in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. Should the capital and surplus fall below said amount, the Monetary Board shall have the same authority as that granted to it under the provisions of the last paragraph of section twenty-two of this Act.<BR>A trust company, so long as it shall continue solvent and comply with the laws of the Philippines, shall have the right to collect the interest earned on any securities so deposited and, from time to time, with the approval of the Monetary Board, to exchange such securities for others.<BR>All claims arising out of the trust business of a trust company shall have priority over all other claims as regards the securities deposited as above provided.

Nothing herein contained shall prevent the accumulation of a larger surplus than that above prescribed should the directors so decide.<BR><BR>SEC. 67. The ordinary business of a trust company shall be transacted at the place of business specified in its articles of incorporation, But any trust company may, with the prior approval of the Monetary Board, establish branches in the Philippines, and the said company shall be responsible for all business conducted in such branches to the same extent and in the same manner as though such business had all been conducted in the head office.<BR>For the purposes of this Act, the company and its branches shall be treated as a unit.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><B>CHAPTER VIII.—<EM>Branches and Agencies of Foreign Banks</EM></B></CENTER><BR>SEC. 68. In the case of a foreign bank which has more than one branch or agency in the Philippines, all such branches and agencies shall be treated as a unit for the purpose of this Act, and all references to Philippine branches and agencies of foreign banks shall be held to refer to such units.<BR><BR>SEC. 69. In the case of Philippine branches of foreign banks, the provisions of this section shall replace those of sections twenty-two and thirty of this Act, except insofar as is specified to the contrary in the last paragraph of this section.<BR>In order to provide effective protection of the interests of the depositors and other creditors of Philippine branches of foreign banks, the head office of such branches shall fully guarantee the prompt payment of all liabilities of its Philippine branch.<BR>The Monetary Board shall from time to time direct the Superintendent of banks to make such investigations as it may deem necessary to ascertain that the aforesaid guarantee by the head office represents effective protection of the depositors and other creditors of the branch.<BR>Should the investigations of the Superintendent of banks indicate that said guarantee is in adequate, the Monetary Board may take such measures as it is authorized to take in the case of capital deficiencies, under the provisions of the third paragraph of section twenty-two of this Act. The Board may, further, as long as the guarantee of the head office is deemed inadequate, require the head office to assign to its Philippine branch an amount of capital sufficient to meet the minimum capital requirement established in section twenty-two of this Act.<BR>Nothing in this section shall be held to prevent a branch of a foreign bank from assignment capital to its Philippine branch, and from being governed by the provisions of section twenty-two or thirty, as the case may be, instead of by the provisions of this section. In such cases, the term "capital accounts" shall be held to include all net amounts due by the branch to its head office and to other branches thereof outside the Philippines.<BR><BR>SEC. 70. In the case of Philippine branches of foreign banks, the present section shall replace sections twenty-three and thirty-two of this Act.<BR>Except as the Monetary Board may otherwise provide, the total liabilities of any person, or of any company, corporation, or firm, to the Philippine branch of a foreign bank for money borrowed, with the exception of money borrowed against obligations of the Central Bank or of the Philippine Government, or borrowed with the full guarantee by the Government of payment of principal and interest, shall at no time exceed fifteen per cent (15%) of the sum of:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The net amount due by such branch to the head office and branches outside the Philippines, and<BR>The total capital accounts, if any, representing funds definitely assigned to the branch by the head office.<BR>The liabilities of any borrower may amount to a further fifteen per cent (15%) of the two items mentioned in subsections (a) and (6) of this section, provided the additional liabilities are adequately secured by shipping documents, warehouse receipts or other similar documents transferring or securing title covering readily marketable, nonperishable staples, which staples must be fully covered by insurance, and must have a market value equal to at least one hundred and twenty-five per cent (125%) of such additional liabilities.nona</BLOCKQUOTE>The term "liabilities" as used herein, shall mean the direct liability of the maker or acceptor of paper discounted with or sold to such bank and the liability of the indorser, drawer, or guarantor who obtains a loan from or discounts paper with or sells paper under his guaranty to such bank and shall include in the case of liabilities of a copartnership or association the liabilities of the several members thereof and shall include in the case of liabilities of a corporation of all subsidiaries thereof in which such corporation owns or controls a majority interest. But the discount of bills of exchange drawn in good faith against actually existing values, and the discount of commercial or business paper actually owned by the person negotiating the same, shall not be considered as money borrowed, for the purposes of this section.<BR>Whenever, and to the extent that, the head office of a Philippine branch of a foreign bank guarantees the repayment of liabilities of its branch, the limitation established in this section shall not apply. Moreover, nothing in this Act shall be construed as restricting in any manner loans made by the Philippine branch of a foreign bank for the account of, and with funds supplied by, its head office or branches outside the Philippines, but the Monetary Board may require that all such loans be reported to it in accordance with such rules and regulations as it may issue on the subject.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><B>CHAPTER IX.—<EM>General Provisions</EM></B></CENTER><BR>SEC. 71. Any opinion, decision, ruling, or regulation made or issued by the Superintendent of Banks may be appealed to the Monetary Board, which shall have the power and authority to confirm, modify or repeal such opinion, decision, ruling or regulation made or issued as aforesaid; but the action of the Monetary Board with respect thereto shall be subject to judicial review.<BR><BR>SEC. 72. In addition to the operations specifically authorized elsewhere in this Act, banking institutions other than building and loan associations may perform the following services:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) Receive in custody funds, documents, and valuable objects, and rent safety deposit boxes for the safeguarding of such effects;<BR>(b) Act as financial agent and buy and sell, by order of and for the account of their customers, shares, evidences of indebtedness and all types of securities;<BR>(c) Make collections and payments for the account of others and perform such other services for their customers as are not incompatible with banking business.</BLOCKQUOTE>The banks shall perform the services permitted under subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section as depositories or as agents. Accordingly, they shall keep the funds, securities and other effects which they thus receive duly separated and apart from the banks own assets and liabilities.<BR>The Monetary Board may regulate the operations authorized by this section in order to insure that said operations do not endanger the interests of the depositors and other creditors of the banks.<BR><BR>SEC. 73. Banking institutions shall not engage in insurance business as the insurer.<BR><BR>SEC. 74. No bank or banking institution shall enter, directly or indirectly, into any contract of guaranty or suretyship, or shall guarantee the interest or principal of any obligation of any person, co-partnership, association, corporation or other entity.  The provisions of this section shall, however, not be held to apply to the borrowing of money by any such bank or institution through the rediscounting of its receivables, or otherwise, as may be permitted by law, nor to the granting or guaranteeing of acceptance credits in the ordinary course of its business. Nor shall the provisions of this section apply to the certification of checks or to transactions involving the release of documents attached to items received for collection, nor to any other transaction which may properly be regarded as common usage and accepted banking practice.<BR><BR>SEC. 75. Banks shall grant loans only in the amounts and for the periods of time essential for the effective completion of the operations to be financed.<BR><BR>SEC. 76. Before granting a loan, banks must exercise proper caution to ascertain that the debtor is capable of fulfilling his commitments to the bank.<BR>Toward this end, banks may demand of their credit applicants a statement of their property and of their income and expenditures.  Should such statement prove to be false or incorrect in any material detail, the bank may terminate any loan granted on the basis of said statement and shall have the right to demand immediate repayment of the obligation.<BR><BR>SEC. 77. The purpose of all loans shall be stated in the contract between the bank and the borrower. If the bank finds that the funds have been employed, without its approval, for purposes other than those agreed upon with the bank, the bank shall have the right to terminate the loan and demand immediate repayment of the obligation.<BR><BR>SEC. 78. Loans against real estate security shall not exceed seventy per cent (70%) of the appraised value of the respective real estate security, plus seventy per cent (70%) of the appraised value of insured improvements, and such loans shall not be made unless title to the real estate, free from all encumbrances, shall be in the mortgagor. In the event of foreclosure, whether judicially or extra judicially, of any mortgage on real estate which is security for any loan granted before the passage of this Act or under the provisions of this Act, the mortgagor or debtor whose real property has been sold at public auction, judicially or extra judicially, for the full or partial payment of an obligation to any bank, banking, or credit institution, within the purview of this Act, shall have the right, within one year after the sale of the real estate as a result of the foreclosure of the respective mortgage, to redeem the property by paying the amount fixed by the court in the order of execution, with interest thereon at the rate specified in the mortgage, and all the costs and other judicial expenses incurred by the bank or institution concerned by reason of the execution and sale and as a result of the custody of said property less the income received from the property.  However, the purchaser at the auction sale concerned shall have the right to enter upon and take possession of such property immediately after the date of the confirmation of the auction sale and administer the same in accordance with law.<BR>Similarly, loans on the security of chattels shall not exceed fifty per cent (50%) of the appraised value of the security, and such loans shall not be made unless title to the chattels, free from all encumbrances, shall be in the mortgagor.<BR>The Monetary Board may, by regulation, prescribe further security requirements to which the various typos of bank credit shall be subject, and, in accordance with the authority granted to it in section one hundred eleven of the Central Bank Act, the Board may by regulation reduce the maximum ratios established in the present section, but in the exercise of the aforementioned authority, the Board shall in no case fix ratios greater than those established herein.<BR>The Monetary Board may, similarly, in accordance with the authority granted to it in section one hundred eleven of the Central Bank Act, reduce the maximum permissible maturities specified in this Act for various types of bank loans, but in no case shall the Board exercise such power to authorize maximum maturities greater than those established in this Act. Any reduction by the Board of the maximum maturities specified in this Act shall apply only to loans made after the date of such action.<BR><BR>SEC. 79. The amortization schedule of bank loans shall be adapted to the nature of the operations to be financed.<BR>In the case of loans with maturities of more than three years, provision must be made for periodic amortization payments, but such payments must be made at least annually:  <EM>Provided, however</EM>, That when the borrowed funds are to be used for purposes which do not initially produce revenues adequate for regular amortization payments therefrom, the bank may permit the initial amortization payment to be deferred until such time as said revenues are sufficient for such purpose, but in no case shall the initial amortization date be later than three years from the date on which the loan is granted.<BR><BR>SEC. 80. Borrowers may at any time prior to the agreed maturity date prepay, in whole or in part, the unpaid balance of any bank loan.<BR><BR>SEC. 81. The Monetary Board may by regulation prescribe the conditions and limitations under which banks may grant extensions or renewals of their loans.<BR><BR>SEC. 82. Banks and banking institutions incorporated under the laws of the Philippines shall not advertise the amount of their authorized or subscribed capital stock without indicating, at the same time and with equal prominence, the amount of their capital actually paid-up.<BR>No branch of any foreign bank doing business in the Philippines shall in any way announce the amount of the capital and surplus of its head office, or of the bank in its entirety without indicating the same time and with equal prominence the amount of the capital, if any, definitely assigned to such branch. In case no capital has been definitely assigned to such branch, such fact shall be stated in, and shall form part of, the advertisement.<BR><BR>SEC. 83. No director or officer of any banking institution shall, either directly or indirectly, for himself or as the representative or agent of others, borrow any of the deposits of funds of such bank, nor shall he become a guarantor, indorser, or surety for loans from such bank to others, or in any manner be an obligor for moneys borrowed from the bank or loaned by it, except with the written approval of the majority of the directors of the bank, excluding the director concerned.  Any such approval shall be entered upon the records of the corporation and a copy of such entry shall be transmitted forthwith to the Superintendent of Banks.  The office of any director or officer of a bank who violates the provisions of this section shall immediately become vacant and the director or officer shall be punished by imprisonment of not less than one year nor more than ten years and by a fine of not less than one thousand nor more than ten thousand pesos.<BR>In addition to the conditions established in the preceding paragraph, no director of a building and loan association shall engage in any of the operations mentioned in said paragraph except upon the pledge of shares of the association having a total withdrawal value greater than the amount borrowed.<BR><BR>SEC. 84. If losses have at any time been sustained by any banking institution equal to or exceeding the undivided profits on hand, no dividend shall be declared; and no dividend shall ever be declared by any such bank while it continues in banking operations to an amount greater than its net profits then on hand, deducting therefrom its losses and bad debts.  All debts due to any such bank on which interest is past due and unpaid for a period of six months, unless the same are well secured and in process of collection, shall be considered bad debts within the meaning of this section.<BR><BR>SEC. 85. Any director or officer of any banking institution who receives or permits or causes to be received in said bank any deposit, or who pays out or permits or causes to be paid out any funds of said bank, or who transfers or permits or causes to be transferred any securities or property of said bank, after said bank becomes insolvent, shall be punished by fine of not less than one thousand nor more than ten thousand pesos and by imprisonment for not less than two nor more than ten years.<BR><BR>SEC. 86. In case of the voluntary liquidation of any bank or banking institution incorporated under the laws of the Philippines, or of any branch in the Philippines of a foreign bank or banking corporation, written notice of such liquidation shall be sent to the Monetary Board before such liquidation is undertaken, and the Monetary Board shall have the right to intervene and take such steps as may be necessary to protect the interests of the creditors.<BR><BR>SEC. 87. Unless otherwise herein provided, the violation of any of the provisions of this Act shall be punished by a fine of not more than two thousand pesos or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or by both. If the violation is committed by a corporation, the same shall, upon such violation being proved, be dissolved by quo warranto proceedings instituted by the Solicitor General: <EM>Provided</EM>, That nothing in this section shall be construed as repealing the other causes for the dissolution of corporations prescribed by existing law, and the remedy provided for in this section shall be considered as additional to the remedies already existing.<BR><BR>
