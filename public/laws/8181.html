<BLOCKQUOTE>"SEC. 201. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Basis of Dutiable Value.</SPAN> – The dutiable value of an imported article subject to an <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">ad valorem </SPAN>rate of duty shall be the transaction value, which shall be the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export to the Philippines, adjusted by adding the following to the extent that they are incurred by the buyer but are not included in the price actually paid or payable for the imported goods:<BR>

<LI>The freight, insurance fees and other transportation expenses for the importation of the goods;<BR></LI></OL></DIV></DIV>If the dutiable value cannot be determined under any of the preceding methods described above, it shall be determined by using other reasonable means consistent with the principles and general provisions of GATT 1994, the agreement on the implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as contained in the Uruguay Round Final Act, and on the basis of data available in the Philippines.<BR><BR>The correct dutiable value of the imported goods referred to above shall be ascertained by the Commissioner of Customs from reports of revenue or commercial attaches or other Philippine diplomatic officers and from such other sources of information as may be available to the Bureau of Customs. Such values shall be established and published by the Commissioner of Customs from time to time, and such values shall be binding upon the importers and the Bureau of Customs until changed and new value or values are similarly established and published.<BR><BR>Values shall be published in at least one (1) newspaper of general circulation and other publications readily available to the public.

<LI>If the sale or price is subject to some consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the goods being valued such as:<BR><BR>
<OL type=i>
<LI>When the seller fixes the price of the imported goods on condition that the buyer will also buy other goods in specified quantities;<BR>
<LI>When the price of the imported goods is dependent upon the price or prices at which the buyer of the imported goods sells other goods to the seller;<BR>
<LI>When the price is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the imported goods, such as where the imported goods are semi-finished goods which have been provided by the seller on the condition that he will receive a specified quantity of finished goods;<BR><BR></LI></OL>
<LI>Or, if part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal or use of the goods by the buyer will accrue directly or indirectly to the seller, unless an appropriate adjustment can be made in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of the agreement in the implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as contained in the Uruguay Round Final Act; and<BR>

<LI>"Similar goods" shall mean goods which although not alike in all respects, have like characteristics and like component materials which enable them to perform the same functions and to be commercially interchangeable. The quality of the goods, their reputation and the existence of a trademark shall be among the factors to be considered in determining whether goods are similar.<BR></LI></OL></LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>SEC. 2. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Transitory Provisions.</SPAN> – Upon the effectivity of this Act and until such time when the Congress authorizes the shift to transaction value before January 1, 2000 as provided under the Section 3 of this Act, the dutiable value of an imported article subject to an <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">ad valorem</SPAN> rate of duty shall be based on the export value at which, at the time of exportation, the same or identical, like, or similar article is freely offered for sale in the principal export markets of the exporting country for exportation to the Philippines, in the usual wholesale quantities and in the ordinary course of trade (excluding internal excise taxes to be remitted or rebated) or where there is none on such date, then on the export value nearest to the date of exportation, including the value of all containers, coverings and/or packings of any kind and all other expenses, costs and charges incident to placing the article in a condition ready for shipment to the Philippines, and freight, as well as insurance premium covering the transportation of such articles to the port of entry in the Philippines.<BR><BR>Where the export value of the article cannot be ascertained thereat or where there exists a reasonable doubt as to the fairness of such value, then the export value of the article for exportation to the Philippines shall be the export value of the article in the principal export markets of the country of manufacture or origin, if such country is not the country of exportation.<BR><BR>Where the export value of the article cannot be ascertained thereat or there exists a reasonable doubt as to the fairness of such value, then the export value of the article shall be the export value of such article for exportation to the Philippines in any third country with the same stage of economic development as the country of exportation.<BR><BR>Where the dutiable value cannot be ascertained as provided in the preceding paragraphs, or where there exists a reasonable doubt as to the dutiable value of the imported article declared in the entry, the dutiable value shall be the domestic wholesale selling price of such or similar article in Metro Manila or other principal markets in the Philippines on the date the duty becomes payable on the article under appraisement, in the usual wholesale quantities and in the ordinary course of trade, minus:<BR>
