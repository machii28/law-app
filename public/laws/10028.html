<BLOCKQUOTE>"SEC. 2. <EM>Declaration of Policy.</EM> — The State adopts rooming-in as a national policy to encourage, protect and support the practice of breastfeeding. It shall create an environment where basic physical, emotional, and psychological needs of mothers and infants are fulfilled through the practice of rooming-in and breastfeeding.<BR><BR>"The State shall likewise protect working women by providing safe and healthful working conditions, taking into account their maternal functions, and such facilities and opportunities that will enhance their welfare and enable them to realize their full potential in the service of the nation. This is consistent with international treaties and conventions to which the Philippines is a signatory such as the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which emphasizes provision of necessary supporting social services to enable parents to combine family obligations with work responsibilities; the Beijing Platform for Action and Strategic Objective, which promotes harmonization of work and family responsibilities for women and men; and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which recognizes a child's inherent right to life and the State's obligations to ensure the child's survival and development.<BR><BR>"Breastfeeding has distinct advantages which benefit the infant and the mother, including the hospital and the country that adopt its practice. It is the first preventive health measure that can be given to the child at birth. It also enhances mother-infant relationship. Furthermore, the practice of breastfeeding could save the country valuable foreign exchange that may otherwise be used for milk importation.<BR><BR>"Breastmilk is the best food since it contains essential nutrients completely suitable for the infant's needs. It is also nature's first immunization, enabling the infant to fight potential serious infection. It contains growth factors that enhance the maturation of an infant's organ systems.<BR><BR>"Towards this end, the State shall promote and encourage breastfeeding and provide the specific measures that would present opportunities for mothers to continue expressing their milk and/or breastfeeding their infant or young child."</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>SEC. 3.
