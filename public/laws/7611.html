<DIV style="TEXT-ALIGN: center"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">CHAPTER II</SPAN><BR style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTAL PLAN:</SPAN><BR style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><BR style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">ADOPTION, PHILOSOPHY AND LEGAL EFFECTS</SPAN><BR></DIV><BR>SEC. 4. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Strategic Environmental Plan.</SPAN> – A comprehensive framework for the sustainable development of Palawan compatible with protecting and enhancing the natural resources and endangered environment of the province is hereby adopted.  Such framework shall be known as the Strategic Environmental Plan for Palawan, hereinafter referred to as SEP, and shall serve to guide the local government of Palawan and the government agencies concerned in the formulation and implementation of plans, programs and projects affecting said province.<BR><BR>SEC. 5. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Strategic Environmental Plan (SEP) Philosophy.</SPAN> – The SEP shall have, as its general philosophy, the sustainable development of Palawan, which is the improvement in the quality of life of its people in the present and future generations through the use of complementary activities of development and conservation that protect life-support ecosystems and rehabilitate exploited areas to allow upcoming generations to sustain development growth. It shall have the following features:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Ecological viability – The physical and biological cycles that maintain the productivity of natural ecosystems must always be kept intact;
<LI>Social acceptability – The people themselves, through participatory processes, should be fully committed to support sustainable development activities by fostering equity in access to resources and the benefits derived from them; and
<LI>Integrated approach – This allows for a holistic view of problems and issues obtaining in the environment as well as opportunities for coordination and sharing that will eventually provide the resources and political will to actually implement and sustain SEP activities.</LI></OL>SEC. 6. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Legal Effects.</SPAN> – The SEP shall serve as the framework to guide the government agencies concerned in the formulation and implementation of plans, programs and projects affecting the environment and natural resources of Palawan.  It shall therefore be incorporated in the Regional Development Plan of Region IV as part of said plan. All local governments in Palawan and the concerned national and regional government agencies operating therein shall coordinate and align their projects and the corresponding budgets with the projects, programs and policies of the SEP, as administered and implemented by an administrative machinery hereinafter created.<BR><BR>SEC. 7. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Environmentally Critical Areas Network (ECAN). </SPAN>– The SEP shall establish a graded system of protection and development control over the whole of Palawan, including its tribal lands, forests, mines, agricultural areas, settlement areas, small islands, mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass beds and the surrounding sea.  This shall be known as the Environmentally Critical Areas Network, hereinafter referred to as ECAN, and shall serve as the main strategy of the SEP.<BR><BR>The ECAN shall ensure the following:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Forest conservation and protection through the imposition of a total commercial logging ban in all areas of maximum protection and in such other restricted use zones as the Palawan Council for Sustainable Development as hereinafter created may provide;
<LI>Protection of watersheds;
<LI>Preservation of biological diversity;
<LI>Protection of tribal people and the preservation of their culture;
<LI>Maintenance of maximum sustainable yield;
<LI>Protection of the rare and endangered species and their habitat;
<LI>Provision of areas for environmental and ecological research, education and training; and
<LI>Provision of areas for tourist and recreation.</LI></OL>SEC. 8. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Main Components.</SPAN> – The areas covered by the ECAN shall be classified into three (3) main components:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Terrestrial – The terrestrial component shall consist of the mountainous as well as ecologically important low hills and lowland areas of the whole province. It may be further subdivided into smaller management components;
<LI>Coastal/marine area – This area includes the whole coastline up to the open sea. This is characterized by active fisheries and tourism activities; and
<LI>Tribal ancestral lands – These are the areas traditionally occupied by the cultural communities.</LI></OL>SEC. 9. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Terrestrial Component: Management Scheme and Zonation.</SPAN> – The terrestrial component may be further subdivided into smaller management components for a more efficient supervision. These management components, in turn, shall each be further subdivided into the following zones:<BR>
<OL type=1>
<LI>Area of maximum protection or core zone – This zone shall be fully and strictly protected and maintained free of human disruption. Included here are all types of natural forest which include first growth forest, residual forest and edges of intact forest, areas above one thousand (1,000) meters elevation, peaks of mountains or other areas with very steep gradients, and endangered habitats and habitats of endangered and rare species. Exceptions, however, may be granted to traditional uses of tribal communities of these areas for minimal and soft impact gathering of forest species for ceremonial and medicinal purposes.<BR>
<LI>Buffer zone – This area permits regulated use and may be further subdivided into three (3) sub-zones:<BR><BR>
<OL type=a>
<LI>Restricted use area. Generally surrounds the core zone and provides a protective barrier. Limited and non-consumptive activities may be allowed in this area;<BR>
<LI>Controlled use area. Encircles and provides the outer barrier to the core and restricted use areas. Controlled forest extraction, like the collecting of minor forest products, and strictly controlled logging and mining may be allowed; and<BR>
<LI>Traditional use area. Edges of intact forests where traditional land use is already stabilized or is being stabilized. Management and control shall be carried out with the other supporting programs of the SEP.</LI></OL><BR>
<LI>Multiple/manipulative use area – This is the area where the landscape has been modified for different forms of land use such as intensive timber extraction, grazing and pastures, agriculture and infrastructure development. Control and management shall be strictly integrated with the other supporting programs of the SEP and other similar programs of the Government.</LI></OL>SEC. 10. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Coastal/Marine Zone.</SPAN> – A different and simplified scheme of management and zonation shall be applied to this component due to its geographical characteristics, critical nature, and patterns of resource use.  Equitable access to the resource and management responsibility by the local community shall be the underlying management philosophy of this component.<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Core zone – This area shall be designated free from any human activity. This includes sanctuaries for rare and endangered species, selected coral reefs, seagrass and mangrove ecosystem reserves.
<LI>Multiple use zone – Aside from being the development area, this zone also serves as the buffer zone where fishery, mariculture, recreation, rehabilitation of small islands and mangrove ecosystem, education and research are allowed.</LI></OL>SEC. 11. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Tribal Ancestral Lands. </SPAN>– These areas, traditionally occupied by cultural minorities, comprise both land and sea areas. These shall be treated in the same graded system of control and prohibition as in the others abovementioned except for stronger emphasis in cultural considerations.  The SEP, therefore, shall define a special kind of zonation to fulfill the material and cultural needs of the tribes using consultative processes and cultural mapping of the ancestral lands.<BR><BR>

It shall measure changes in environmental status, identify adverse environmental trends and crisis areas, recommend solutions, assess the implementation of the SEP, and suggest measures to make the SEP more responsible to the changing needs.<BR><BR>SEC. 14. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Environmental Research. </SPAN>– The SEP shall provide for a system of research so that additional information for accurate planning as well as data to solve new problems in the implementation of the SEP shall be supplied.  As such, the SEP's researches shall not be confined to the physical and biological features of the environment, achieved through surveys, monitoring, resource assessments and research into processes, but shall also extend to policies and socioeconomic questions.<BR><BR>SEC. 15. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Environmental Education and Extension.</SPAN> – The SEP shall design an environmental information and education designed to gradually wean the people away from destructive practices and shall recommend practical ways as an alternative.<BR><BR>Training programs for the nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), business sector representatives, and community leaders shall be organized.  This may establish linkages between the NGOS, community leaders, sector representatives and the staff of line agencies' development communication or public information section and, at the same time, be used to plan out a comprehensive public information drive.<BR><BR>Simultaneously, community organizing shall be enhanced to reinforce non-formal approaches, complementing regular environment/science courses in the school.<BR><BR>
