<LI><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Method Two. - Transaction Value of Identical Goods.</SPAN> — Where the dutiable value cannot be determined under method one, the dutiable value shall be the transaction value of identical goods sold for export to the Philippines and exported at or about the same time as the goods being valued. "Identical goods" shall mean goods which are the same in all respects, including physical characteristics, quality and reputation. Minor differences in appearances shall not preclude goods otherwise conforming to the definition from being regarded as identical.
<LI><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Method Three. - Transaction Value of Similar Goods.</SPAN> — Where the dutiable value cannot be determined under the preceding method, the dutiable value shall be the transaction value of similar goods sold for export to the Philippines and exported at or about the same time as the goods being valued. "Similar goods" shall mean goods which, although not alike in all respects, have like characteristics and like component materials which enable them to perform the same functions and to be commercially interchangeable. The quality of the goods, their reputation and the existence of a trademark shall be among the factors to be considered in determining whether goods are similar.<BR><BR>If the dutiable value still cannot be determined through the successive application of the two immediately preceding methods, the dutiable value shall be determined under method four or, when the dutiable value still cannot be determined under that method, under method fivhoe, except that, at the request of the importer, the order of application of methods four and five shall be reversed: Provided, however, That if the Commissioner of Customs deems that he will experience real difficulties in determining the dutiable value using method five, the Commissioner of Customs may refuse such a request in which event the dutiable value shall be determined under method four, if it can be so determined.<BR><BR>
<LI><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Method Four. - Deductive Value.</SPAN> — The dutiable value of the imported goods under this method shall be the deductive value which shall be based on the unit price at which the imported goods or identical or similar imported goods are sold in the Philippines, in the same condition as when imported, in the greatest aggregate quantity, at or about the time of the importation of the goods being valued, to persons not related to the persons from whom they buy such goods, subject to deductions for the following:<BR><BR>
<OL>
<LI>Either the commissions usually paid or agreed to be paid or the additions usually made for profit and general expenses in connection with sales in such country of imported goods of the same class or kind;
<LI>The usual costs of transport and insurance and associated costs incurred within the Philippines; and
<LI>Where appropriate, the costs and charges referred to in subsection (A) (3), (4) and (5); and
<LI>The customs duties and other national taxes payable in the Philippines by reason of the importation or sale of the goods.</LI></OL><BR>If neither the imported goods nor identical nor similar imported goods are sold at or about the time of importation of the goods being valued in the Philippines in the conditions as imported, the customs value shall, subject to the conditions set forth in the preceding paragraph hereof, be based on the unit price at which the imported goods or identical or similar imported goods sold in the Philippines in the condition as imported at the earliest date after the importation of the goods being valued but before the expiration of ninety (90) days after such importation.<BR><BR>If neither the imported goods nor identical nor similar imported goods are sold in the Philippines in the condition as imported, then, if the importer so requests, the dutiable value shall be based on the unit price at which the imported goods, after further processing, are sold in the greatest aggregate quantity to persons in the Philippines who are not related to the persons from whom they buy such goods, subject to allowance for the value added by such processing and deductions provided under Subsections (D)(1), (2), (3) and (4) hereof.<BR><BR>
<LI><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Method Five. - Computed Value.</SPAN> — The dutiable value under this method shall be the computed value which shall be the sum of:<BR><BR>
<OL>
<LI>The cost or value of materials and fabrication or other processing employed in producing the imported goods;
<LI>The amount for profit and general expenses equal to that usually reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued which are made by producers in the country of exportation for export to the Philippines;
<LI>The freight, insurance fees and other transportation expenses for the importation of the goods;
<LI>Any assist, if its value is not included under paragraph (1) hereof; and
<LI>The cost of containers and packing, if their values are not included under paragraph (1) hereof.</LI></OL><BR>The Bureau of Customs shall not require or compel any person not residing in the Philippines to produce for examination, or to allow access to, any account or other record for the purpose of determining a computed value. However, information supplied by the producer of the goods for the purposes of determining the customs value may be verified in another country with the agreement of the producer and provided they will give sufficient advance notice to the government of the country in question and the latter does not object to the investigation.<BR><BR>
<LI><SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Method Six. - Fallback Value.</SPAN> — If the dutiable value cannot be determined under the preceding methods described above, it shall be determined by using other reasonable means and on the basis of data available in the Philippines.<BR><BR>If the importer so requests, the importer shall be informed in writing of the dutiable value determined under Method Six and the method used to determine such value.<BR><BR>No dutiable value shall be determined under Method Six on the basis of:<BR><BR>
<OL>
<LI>The selling price in the Philippines of goods produced in the Philippines;
<LI>A system that provides for the acceptance for customs purposes of the higher of two alternative values;
<LI>The price of goods in the domestic market of the country of exportation;
<LI>The cost of production, other than computed values, that have been determined for identical or similar goods in accordance with Method Five hereof;
<LI>The price of goods for export to a country other than the Philippines;
<LI>Minimum customs values; or
<LI>Arbitrary or fictitious values.</LI></OL><BR>If in the course of determining the dutiable value of imported goods, it becomes necessary to delay the final determination of such dutiable value, the importer shall nevertheless be able to secure the release of the imported goods upon the filing of a sufficient guarantee in the form of a surety bond, a deposit, cash or some other appropriate instrument in an amount equivalent to the imposable duties and taxes on the imported goods in question conditioned upon the payment of customs duties and taxes for which the imported goods may be liable: <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Provided, however,</SPAN> That goods, the importation of which is prohibited by law shall not be released under any circumstance whatsoever.<BR><BR>Nothing in this Section shall be construed as restricting or calling into question the right of the Collector of Customs to satisfy himself as to the truth or accuracy of any statement, document or declaration presented for customs valuation purposes. When a declaration has been presented and where the customs administration has reason to doubt the truth or accuracy of the particulars or of documents produced in support of this declaration, the customs administration may ask the importer to provide further explanation, including documents or other evidence, that the declared value represents the total amount actually paid or payable for the imported goods, adjusted in accordance with the provisions of Subsection (A) hereof.<BR><BR>If, after receiving further information, or in the absence of a response, the customs administration still has reasonable doubts about the truth or accuracy of the declared value, it may, without prejudice to an importer's right to appeal pursuant to Article 11 of the World Trade Organization Agreement on customs valuation, be deemed that the customs value of the imported goods cannot be determined under Method One. Before taking a final decision, the Collector of Customs shall communicate to the importer, in writing if requested, his grounds for doubting the truth or accuracy of the particulars or documents produced and give the importer a reasonable opportunity to respond. When a final decision is made, the customs administration shall communicate to the importer in writing its decision and the grounds therefor."<BR></LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>SEC. 2.
