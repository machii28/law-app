The State adopts the use of tariffs in lieu of non-tariff import restrictions to protect local producers of agricultural products, except in the case of rice, which will continue to have quantitative import restrictions.<BR><BR>Consistent with the constitutional mandate of protecting Filipino firms against unfair trade, it is furthermore the policy of the State to employ anti-dumping and countervailing measures to protect local producers from unfair trade practices, rather than use quantitative import restrictions.<BR><BR>To help the agricultural sector compete globally, the State shall seek to raise farm productivity levels by providing the necessary support services such as, but not limited to, irrigation, farm-to-market roads, post-harvest equipment and facilities, credit, research and development, extension services, other market infrastructure and market information.<BR><BR>SEC. 3.<SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic"> Definition of Terms</SPAN>. – The following definitions apply to the terms used in this Act:<BR>
