<OL type=a>

In rendering its decisions, the Court shall not be bound solely by the evidence presented during the hearing but may avail itself of all other means such as (but not limited to) ocular inspections and questioning of well-informed persons which results must be made a part of the record. In the proceeding before the Court or a Hearing Examiner thereof, the parties shall not be required to be represented by legal counsel and it shall be the duty and obligation of the Court or Hearing Examiner to examine and cross-examine witnesses on behalf of the parties and to assist in the orderly presentation of the evidence. <BR>
<LI>The testimony taken by the Court or such member of the Court or the Hearing Examiner shall be reduced to writing and filed with the Court.

<OL>
<LI>That unlawful acts have been threatened and will be committed unless restrained, or have been committed and will be continued unless restrained, but no injunction or temporary restraining order shall be issued on account of any threat or unlawful act excepting against the person or persons, association, or organization making the threat or committing the unlawful act or actually authorizing or ratifying the same after actual knowledge thereof; <BR>

<LI>That the public officers charged with the duty to protect complainant's property are unable or unwilling to furnish adequate protection. </LI></OL><BR>Such hearing shall be held after due and personal notice thereof has been given, in such manner as the Court shall direct, to all known persons against whom relief is sought, and also to the chief of those public officials of the province or city within which the unlawful acts have been threatened or committed charged with the duty to protect complainant's property: Provided, however, That if a complainant shall also allege that, unless a temporary restraining order shall be issued without notice, a substantial and irreparable injury to complainant's property will be unavoidable, such a temporary restraining order may be issued upon testimony under oath, sufficient, if sustained, to justify the court in issuing a temporary injunction upon hearing after notice. Such a temporary restraining order shall be effective for no longer than five days and shall become void at the expiration of said five days. No temporary restraining order or temporary injunction shall be issued except on condition that complainant shall first file an undertaking with adequate security in an amount to be fixed by the Court sufficient to recompense those enjoined for any loss, expense, or damage caused by the improvident or erroneous issuance of such order or injunction, including all reasonable costs, (together with a reasonable attorney's fee) and expense of defense against the order or against the granting of any injunctive relief sought in the same proceeding and subsequently denied by the Court. <BR><BR>The undertaking herein mentioned shall be understood to signify an agreement entered into by the complainant and the surety upon which a decree may be rendered in the same suit or proceeding against said complainant and surety, upon a hearing to assess damages of which hearing complainant and surety shall have reasonable notice, the said complainant and surety submitting themselves to the jurisdiction of the court for that purpose. But nothing herein contained shall deprive any party having a claim or cause of action under or upon such undertaking from electing to pursue his ordinary remedy by suit at law or in equity<BR><BR>
<LI>No restraining order or injunctive relief shall be granted to any complainant who has failed to comply with any obligation imposed by law which is involved in the labor dispute in question, or who has failed to make every reasonable effort to settle such dispute by negotiation or with the aid of any available governmental machinery of mediation or by voluntary arbitration. <BR><BR>
<LI>No restraining order or temporary or permanent injunction shall be granted in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute, except on the basis of findings of fact made and filed by the court in the record of the case prior to the issuance of such restraining order or injunction; and every restraining order or injunction granted in a case involving or growing out of a labor dispute shall include only prohibition of such specific act or acts as may be expressly complained of in the bill of complaint or petition filed in such case and as shall be expressly included in said findings of fact made and filed by the court as provided herein: <BR><BR>
<OL>

The Department of Labor shall transmit the results of the election to the Court for its determination within seven days of the certification election. <BR>

<LI>In case differences shall arise on the basis of such proposals and reply, either party may request a conference which shall begin not later than ten days from the making of such request. Both parties shall endeavor in such conference to settle the dispute amicably and expeditiously. <BR>
<LI>If the dispute is not settled by conference and the Conciliation Service of the Department of Labor intervenes in the dispute, it shall be the duty of each party to participate fully and promptly in such meetings and conferences as the Service may undertake. <BR>
<LI>Before an employer may lockout his employees or the employees may strike, either party as the case may be, must file with the Conciliation Service thirty days prior thereto a notice of their intention to strike or lockout the employees. Such notice shall be in a form to be prescribed by the Chief of the Conciliation Service.<BR></LI></OL>SEC. 15. <EM>Violation of Duty to Bargain Collectively</EM>.—It shall be unlawful for any employer to refuse to bargain collectively with the representative of his employees, or to declare a lockout without having first bargained collectively with the representative of his employees, in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Any employee whose work has stopped as a consequence of such lockout shall be entitled to back-pay. <BR><BR>The refusal of a labor organization to bargain collectively with an employer or the declaration of a strike by such organization without having first bargained collectively with an employer pursuant to this Act, shall be sufficient cause for the Court of Industrial Relations to deny to said union all rights and privileges under this Act. Any employee who participates in such strike shall lose his status as an employee for the purposes of this Act. <BR><BR>The declaration of a strike by a labor organization or a lockout by an employer where no previous notice of a desire to negotiate an agreement has been served upon the other party as provided in Section 14, shall be deemed prima facie evidence of a violation of the duty to bargain collectively. <BR><BR>SEC. 16. <EM>Administration of Agreement and Handling of Grievances</EM>.—The parties to collective bargaining shall endeavor to include in their agreement provisions to insure Mutual observance of the terms and stipulations of the agreement and to establish machinery for the adjustment of grievances, including any question that may arise from the application or interpretation of the agreement or day-to-day relationships in the establishment. <BR><BR>SEC. 17. <EM>Rights and Conditions of Membership in Labor Organizations</EM>.—It is hereby declared to be the public policy of the Philippines to encourage the following internal labor organization procedures.

If the Court finds, upon investigation, evidence to substantiate the alleged violation and that efforts to correct the alleged violation through the procedures provided by the labor organization's constitution or by-laws have been exhausted, the Court shall dispose of the complaint as in "unfair labor practice" cases.<BR>
<OL type=a>
<LI>Arbitrary or excessive initiation fees shall not be required of the members of a legitimate labor organization nor shall arbitrary, excessive or oppressive fines and forfeitures be imposed. <BR>
