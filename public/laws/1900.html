In case two or more Civic Organizations offer to undertake the project, the official concerned shall award the contract to the organizations offering the lowest quotation, determined by sealed bidding to be opened in the Municipal Building of the Municipality where the project is located within ten days, but not earlier than seven days, after notice of such bidding is posted on the Public Bulletin Board of said municipality.<BR><BR>The authority of the District Engineer or his official counterpart to undertake any work by administration or through negotiated contract as herein provided for shall be deemed to have been duly secured upon receipt by the Provincial or City Auditor of the official advice to the head of the Bureau or office concerned to so prosecute the work.<BR><BR>Under no circumstances shall the provisions of this section be construed to deprive the District Engineer or his official counterpart as the case may be, of his supervisory control over any of the projects referred to in this section nor to relieve him of any responsibility, administrative or otherwise, for any defect in procedure, control or technical surveillance, resulting in waste of money, destruction of, or damage to, property or lowering of engineering standards. In cases where the work is undertaken through negotiated contract with a civic organization the District Engineer, or his official counterpart, may not charge any expense for inspection by him or his assistant but he may designate as his representative and assign to the project as worker-inspector any competent craftsman whose compensation and travel expenses for the duration of the assignment shall be chargeable against the funds of the project but not against the contract and shall not exceed one percent of the contract price. The District Engineer or his official counterpart, may make any other suitable arrangement to enable him to maintain supervisory control over the project without however exceeding the compensation-limitation herein imposed.<BR><BR>SEC. 7.

In no case, however, may this margin of contingencies be more than ten percent of the cost of the work nor the allowance for profit be more than fifteen percent. For work being undertaken by administration; the engineer concerned may, however, be allowed to submit a revised program of work before the completion of the project if, due to unforeseen rise in price of materials or to changes in field conditions or to other such circumstances, it becomes evident that the allowance for contingencies is not sufficient to absorb the increase and, therefore, he cannot successfully accomplish the work according to his original program.
