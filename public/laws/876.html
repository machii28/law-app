<OL type=a>
<LI>to waive the presumptive disqualifying circumstances; or <BR>
<LI>to declare the office of such arbitrator vacant.

An award shall not be made solely on the default of a party. The arbitrators shall require the other party to submit such evidence as they may require for making an award. <BR><BR>No one other than a party to said arbitration, or a person in the regular employ of such party duly authorized in writing by said party, or a practicing attorney-at-law, shall be permitted by the arbitrators to represent before him or them any party to the arbitration. Any party desiring to be represented by counsel shall notify the other party or parties of such intention at least five days prior to the hearing. <BR><BR>The arbitrators shall arrange for the taking of a stenographic record of the testimony when such a record is requested by one or more parties, and when payment of the cost thereof is assumed by such party or parties. <BR><BR>Persons having a direct interest in the controversy which is the subject of arbitration shall have the right to attend any hearing; but the attendance of any other person shall be at the discretion of the arbitrators. <BR><BR>SEC. 13. <EM>Oath of arbitrators</EM>.—Before hearing any testimony, arbitrators must be sworn, by any officer authorized by law to administer an oath, faithfully and fairly to hear and examine the matters in controversy and to make a just award according to the best of their ability and understanding.

This oath shall be required of every witness before any of his testimony is heard. <BR><BR>SEC. 14. <EM>Subpoena and subpoena duces tecum</EM>.—Arbitrators shall have the power to require any person to attend a hearing as a witness. They shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and documents when the relevancy of the testimony and the materiality thereof has been demonstrated to the arbitrators. Arbitrators may also require the retirement of any witness during the testimony of any other witness. All of the arbitrators appointed in any controversy must attend all the hearings in that matter and hear all the allegations and proofs of the parties; but an award by the majority of them is valid unless the concurrence of all of them is expressly required in the submission or contract to arbitrate. The arbitrator or arbitrators shall have the power at any time, before rendering the award, without prejudice to the rights of any party to petition the court to take measures to safeguard and/or conserve any matter which is the subject of the dispute in arbitration. <BR><BR>SEC. 15. <EM>Hearing by arbitrators</EM>.—Arbitrators may, at the commencement of the hearing, ask both parties for brief statements of the issues in controversy and/or an agreed statement of facts.

The arbitrators shall be the sole judge of the relevancy and materiality of the evidence offered or produced, and shall not be bound to conform to the Rules of Court pertaining to evidence. Arbitrators shall receive as exhibits in evidence any document which the parties may wish to submit, and the exhibits shall be properly identified at the time of submission. All exhibits shall remain in the custody of the Clerk of Court during the course of the arbitration and shall be returned to the parties at the time the award is made. The arbitrators may make an ocular inspection of any matter or premises which are in dispute, but such inspection shall be made only in the presence of all parties to the arbitration, unless any party who shall have received notice thereof fails to appear, in which event such inspection shall be made in the absence of such party. <BR><BR>SEC. 16. <EM>Briefs</EM>.—At the close of the hearings, the arbitrators shall specifically inquire of all parties whether they have any further proof or witnesses to present; upon the receipt of a negative reply from all parties, the arbitrators shall declare the hearing closed unless the parties have signified an intention to file briefs. Then the hearing shall be closed by the arbitrators after the receipt of briefs and/or reply briefs. Definite time limit for the filing of such briefs must be fixed by the arbitrators at the close of the hearing. Briefs may be filed by the parties within fifteen days after the close of the oral hearings; the reply briefs, if any, shall be filed within five days following such fifteen-day period. <BR><BR>SEC. 17. <EM>Reopening of hearing</EM>.—The hearing may be reopened by the arbitrators on their own motion or upon the request of any party, upon good cause, shown at any time before the award is rendered. When hearings are thus reopened the effective date for the closing of the hearings shall be the date of the closing of the reopened hearing. <BR><BR>SEC. 18. <EM>Proceeding in lieu of hearing</EM>.—The parties to a submission or contract to arbitrate may, by written agreement, submit their dispute to arbitration by other than oral hearing. The parties may submit an agreed statement of facts. They may also submit their respective contentions to the duly appointed arbitrators in writing; this shall include a statement of facts, together with all documentary proof. Parties may also submit a written argument. Each party shall provide all other parties to the dispute with a copy of all statements and documents submitted to the arbitrators. Each party shall have an opportunity to reply in writing to any other party's statements and proofs; but if such party fails to do so within seven days after receipt of such statements and Proofs, he shall be deemed to have waived his right to reply. Upon the delivery to the arbitrators of all statements and documents, together with any reply state-tents, the arbitrators shall declare the proceedings in lieu of hearing closed. <BR><BR>SEC. 19. <EM>Time for rendering award</EM>.—Unless the parties shall have stipulated by written agreement the time within which the arbitrators must render their award, the written award of the arbitrators shall be rendered within thirty days after the closing of the hearings or if the oral hearings shall have been waived, within thirty days after the arbitrators shall have declared such proceedings in lieu of hearing closed. This period may be extended by mutual consent of the parties. <BR><BR>SEC. 20. <EM>Form and contents of award</EM>.—The award must be made in writing and signed and acknowledged by a majority of the arbitrators, if more than one; and by the sole arbitrator, if there is only one. Each party shall be furnished with a copy of the award. The arbitrators in their award may grant any remedy or relief which they deem just and equitable and within the scope of the agreement of the parties, which shall include, but not be limited to, the specific performance of a contract. <BR><BR>In the event that the parties to an arbitration have, during the course of such arbitration, settled their dispute, they may request of the arbitrators that such settlement be embodied in an award which shall be signed by the arbitrators. No arbitrator shall act as a mediator in any proceeding in which he is acting as arbitrator; and all negotiations towards settlement of the dispute must take place without the presence of the arbitrators. <BR><BR>The arbitrators shall have the power to decide only those matters which have been submitted to them, The terms of the award shall be confined to such disputes. <BR><BR>The arbitrators shall have the power to assess in their award the expenses of any party against another party, when such assessment shall be deemed necessary. <BR><BR>SEC. 21. <EM>Fees of arbitration</EM>.—The fees of the arbitrators shall be fifty pesos per day unless the parties agree otherwise in writing prior to the arbitration.<BR><BR>SEC. 22. <EM>Arbitration deemed a special proceeding</EM>.—Arbitration under a contract or submission shall be deemed a special proceeding, of which the court specified in the contract or submission, or if none be specified, the Court of First Instance for the province or city in which one of the parties resides or is doing business, or in which the arbitration was held, shall have jurisdiction.
