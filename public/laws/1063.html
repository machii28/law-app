Changes in the estimates and appropriations may be made from time to time during the year by supplemental budgets in the same manner as the annual budget: <EM>Provided, </EM>That no changes shall be made to appropriations made for health without first consulting the chief of the sanitary division."<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>SEC. 2.
