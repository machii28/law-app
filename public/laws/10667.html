<P><EM>Provided, further,</EM> That any conduct which contributes to improving production or distribution of goods or services within the relevant market, or promoting technical and economic progress while allowing consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit may not necessarily be considered an abuse of dominant position: </P>
<P><EM>Provided, finally,</EM> That the foregoing shall not constrain the Commission or the relevant regulator from pursuing measures that would promote fair competition or more competition as provided in this Act. </P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER IV<BR>MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS </P>
<P>SEC. 16. <EM>Review of Mergers and Acquisitions. —</EM> The Commission shall have the power to review mergers and acquisitions based on factors deemed relevant by the Commission. </P>
<P>SEC. 17. <EM>Compulsory Notification.</EM> – Parties to the merger or acquisition agreement referred to in the preceding section wherein the value of the transaction exceeds one billion pesos (P1,000,000,000.00) are prohibited from consummating their agreement until thirty (30) days after providing notification to the Commission in the form and containing the information specified in the regulations issued by the Commission: <EM>Provided,</EM> That the Commission shall promulgate other criteria, such as increased market share in the relevant market in excess of minimum thresholds, that may be applied specifically to a sector, or across some or all sectors, in determining whether parties to a merger or acquisition shall notify the Commission under this Chapter. </P>
<P>An agreement consummated in violation of this requirement to notify the Commission shall be considered void and subject the parties to an administrative fine of one percent (1%) to five percent (5%) of the value of the transaction. </P>
<P>Should the Commission deem it necessary, it may request further information that are reasonably necessary and directly relevant to the prohibition under Section 20 hereof from the parties to the agreement before the expiration of the thirty (30)-day period referred. The issuance of such a request has the effect of extending the period within which the agreement may not be consummated for an additional sixty (60) days, beginning on the day after the request for information is received by the parties: <EM>Provided,</EM> That, in no case shall the total period for review by the Commission of the subject agreement exceed ninety (90) days from initial notification by the parties. </P>
<P>When the above periods have expired and no decision has been promulgated for whatever reason, the merger or acquisition shall be deemed approved and the parties may proceed to implement or consummate it. All notices, documents and information provided to or emanating from the Commission under this section shall be subject to confidentiality rule under Section 34 of this Act except when the release of information contained therein is with the consent of the notifying entity or is mandatorily required to be disclosed by law or by a valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or of a government or regulatory agency, including an exchange. </P>
<P>In the case of the merger or acquisition of banks, banking institutions, building and loan associations, trust companies, insurance companies, public utilities, educational institutions and other special corporations governed by special laws, a favorable or no-objection ruling by the Commission shall not be construed as dispensing of the requirement for a favorable recommendation by the appropriate government agency under Section 79 of the Corporation Code of the Philippines. </P>
<P>A favorable recommendation by a governmental agency with a competition mandate shall give rise to a disputable presumption that the proposed merger or acquisition is not violative of this Act. </P>
<P>SEC. 18. <EM>Effect of Notification. —</EM> If within the relevant periods stipulated in the preceding section, the Commission determines that such agreement is prohibited under Section 20 and does not qualify for exemption under Section 21 of this Chapter, the Commission may: </P>
<P>(a) Prohibit the implementation of the agreement; </P>
<P>(b) Prohibit the implementation of the agreement unless and until it is modified by changes specified by the Commission. </P>
<P>(c) Prohibit the implementation of the agreement unless and until the pertinent party or parties enter into legally enforceable agreements specified by the Commission. </P>

<P>(a) The transaction value threshold and such other criteria subject to the notification requirement of Section 17 of this Act; </P>
<P>(b) The information that must be supplied for notified merger or acquisition; </P>
<P>(c) Exceptions or exemptions from the notification requirement; and </P>
<P>(d) Other rules relating to the notification procedures. </P>
<P>SEC. 20. <EM>Prohibited. Mergers and Acquisitions.</EM> – Merger or acquisition agreements that substantially prevent, restrict or lessen competition in the relevant market or in the market for goods or services as may be determined by the Commission shall be prohibited. </P>
<P>SEC. 21. <EM>Exemptions from Prohibited. Mergers and Acquisitions.</EM> – Merger or acquisition agreement prohibited under Section 20 of this Chapter may, nonetheless, be exempt from prohibition by the Commission when the parties establish either of the following: </P>
<P>(a) The concentration has brought about or is likely to bring about gains in efficiencies that are greater than the effects of any limitation on competition that result or likely to result from the merger or acquisition agreement; or </P>
<P>(b) A party to the merger or acquisition agreement is faced with actual or imminent financial failure, and the agreement represents the least anti-competitive arrangement among the known alternative uses for the failing entity’s assets: </P>
<P><EM>Provided,</EM> That an entity shall not be prohibited from continuing to own and hold the stock or other share capital or assets of another corporation which it acquired prior to the approval of this Act or acquiring or maintaining its market share in a relevant market through such means without violating the provisions of this Act: </P>
<P><EM>Provided, further,</EM> That the acquisition of the stock or other share capital of one or more corporations solely for investment and not used for voting or exercising control and not to otherwise bring about, or attempt to bring about the prevention, restriction, or lessening of competition in the relevant market shall not be prohibited. </P>
<P>SEC. 22. <EM>Burden of Proof.</EM> – The burden of proof under Section 21 lies with the parties seeking the exemption. A party seeking to rely on the exemption specified in Section 21(a) must demonstrate that if the agreement were not implemented, significant efficiency gains would not be realized. </P>
<P>SEC. 23. <EM>Finality of Ridings on Mergers and Acquisitions. –</EM> Merger or acquisition agreements that have received a favorable ruling from the Commission, except when such ruling was obtained on the basis of fraud or false material information, may not be challenged under this Act. </P>
<P align=center>CHAPTER V<BR>DISPOSITION OF CASES </P>
<P>SEC. 24. <EM>Relevant Market.</EM> – For purposes of determining the relevant market, the following factors, among others, affecting the substitutability among goods or services constituting such market and the geographic area delineating the boundaries of the market shall be considered: </P>
<P>(a) The possibilities of substituting the goods or services in question, with others of domestic or foreign origin, considering the technological possibilities, extent to which substitutes are available to consumers and time required for such substitution; </P>
<P>(b) The cost of distribution of the good or service, its raw materials, its supplements and substitutes from other areas and abroad, considering freight, insurance, import duties and non-tariff restrictions; the restrictions imposed by economic agents or by their associations; and the time required to supply the market from those areas; </P>
<P>(c) The cost and probability of users or consumers seeking other markets; and </P>
<P>(d) National, local or international restrictions which limit access by users or consumers to alternate sources of supply or the access of suppliers to alternate consumers. </P>
<P>SEC. 25. <EM>Control of an Entity.</EM> – In determining the control of an entity, the Commission may consider the following: </P>
<P>Control is presumed to exist when the parent owns directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries, more than one half (1/2) of the voting power of an entity, unless in exceptional circumstances, it can clearly be demonstrated that such ownership does not constitute control. Control also exists even when an entity owns one half (1/2) or less of the voting power of another entity when: </P>
<P>(a) There is power over more than one half (1/2) of the voting rights by virtue of an agreement with investors; </P>
<P>(b) There is power to direct or govern the financial and operating policies of the entity under a statute or agreement; </P>
<P>(c) There is power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors or equivalent governing body; </P>
<P>(d) There is power to cast the majority votes at meetings of the board of directors or equivalent governing body; </P>
<P>(e) There exists ownership over or the right to use all or a significant part of the assets of the entity; </P>
<P>(f) There exist rights or contracts which confer decisive influence on the decisions of the entity. </P>
<P>SEC. 26. <EM>Determination of Anti-Competitive Agreement or Conduct.</EM> – In determining whether anti-competitive agreement or conduct has been committed, the Commission shall: </P>
<P>(a) Define the relevant market allegedly affected by the anti-competitive agreement or conduct, following the principles laid out in Section 24 of this Chapter; </P>
<P>(b) Determine if there is actual or potential adverse impact on competition in the relevant market caused by the alleged agreement or conduct, and if such impact is substantial and outweighs the actual or potential efficiency gains that result from the agreement or conduct; </P>
<P>(c) Adopt a broad and forward-looking perspective, recognizing future market developments, any overriding need to make the goods or services available to consumers, the requirements of large investments in infrastructure, the requirements of law, and the need of our economy to respond to international competition, but also taking account of past behavior of the parties involved and prevailing market conditions; </P>
<P>(d) Balance the need to ensure that competition is not prevented or substantially restricted and the risk that competition efficiency, productivity, innovation, or development of priority areas or industries in the general interest of the country may be deterred by overzealous or undue intervention; and </P>
<P>(e) Assess the totality of evidence on whether it is more likely than not that the entity has engaged in anti-competitive agreement or conduct including whether the entity’s conduct was done with a reasonable commercial purpose such as but not limited to phasing out of a product or closure of a business, or as a reasonable commercial response to the market entry or conduct of a competitor. </P>
<P>SEC. 27. <EM>Market Dominant Position.</EM> – In determining whether an entity has market dominant position for purposes of this Act, the Commission shall consider the following: </P>
<P>(a) The share of the entity in the relevant market and whether it is able to fix prices unilaterally or to restrict supply in the relevant market; </P>
<P>(b) The existence of barriers to entry and the elements which could foreseeably alter both said barriers and the supply from competitors; </P>
<P>(c) The existence and power of its competitors; </P>
<P>(d) The possibility of access by its competitors or other entities to its sources of inputs; </P>
<P>(e) The power of its customers to switch to other goods or services; </P>
<P>(f) Its recent conducts; and </P>
<P>(g) Other criteria established by the regulations of this Act. </P>
