In such cases the applicable provisions of the Rules of Court shall be availed of; and<BR>
<LI>Should the order of the Corporation involve the filling of the lowlands in the city or any populous town of Cebu, the owner of the land or the Corporation may avail themselves of the provisions of Act Numbered Thirty-three hundred and fifty-two, as amended, known as the Lowland Improvement Act, and upon petition of the Corporation, or at the request of the owner made within fifteen days after receipt of an order of the Corporation requiring the filling of his land, the Mayor concerned shall, if there be sufficient money available for expenditure in the fund created by said Act, condemn the land complained of and require that it be filled pursuant to said Act.</LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>SEC. 20.
