In the event of any competing individual, partnership, or corporation receiving from the Congress a similar franchise in which there shall be any term or terms more favorable than those herein granted or tending to place the herein grantee at any disadvantage, then such term or terms shall<EM>ipso facto</EM> become a part of the terms hereof and shall operate equally in favor of the grantee as in the case of said competing individual, partnership, or corporation.<BR><BR>SEC. 4.

The grantee, his successors or assigns, shall be subject to the corporation laws of the Philippines now existing or hereafter enacted.<BR><BR>SEC. 13.
