In addition to the races mentioned in Section one of this Act, a national race shall also be held on a day in the month of February or March of each year to be fixed by the Philippine Anti-Tuberculosis Society two months in advance. At this national race, there shall be three special races, one to be known as the 'Senior Grand Derby' which shall be for horses in excess of fifty-eight inches in height and shall be run over a distance of one mile; another to be known as the 'Junior Grand Derby' which shall be run over the same distance and in which only horses not over fifty-eight inches in height may be entered; and still another to be known as the 'Special Grand Derby' which shall be run over the distance of one and one-eight miles and in which only  Filipino owned imported thoroughbred male horses which are not gelded and female horses in excess of sixty-inches in height and not less than two and one-half years but not over four years old may participate.

The age of the horse shall be determined from the date of foal. Once an imported thoroughbred horse has parti&shy;cipated in the race herein indicated, the same shall not be exported out of the Philippines except to participate in international races and immediately thereafter the horse shall be returned to the Philippines. In the 'Senior Grand Derby' and 'Junior Grand Derby' races, only horses may participate that have taken part in the 'griffins' races held during the previous year in accordance with this Act: Provided, That in order that a horse may take part in the 'Senior Grand Derby' and 'Junior Grand Derby' races, it shall be registered thirty days previously: <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">And provided, further,</SPAN> That horses winning the first, second and third places in the Sweepstakes' races held during the previous year, with the exception of imported thoroughbred horses, may also participate in these races and shall be subject to such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Society for the purposes of this Act. In handicapping horses entered in all Grand Derby races, the same rule as provided for in Section one hereof shall be applied. The other races of said day shall be ordinary races in which serial horses may participate.<BR><BR>"SEC.
