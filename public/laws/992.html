<BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL type=a>
<LI>No appropriation authorized for any department and agency of the Government shall be available for expenditure until the head of each department or agency shall have submitted to the Budget Commissioner a request for allotment of funds showing the estimated amounts needed for each function, activity, or purpose for which the funds are to be expended during the applicable allotment period and until the request shall have been approved by the Commissioner as hereinafter provided. The form of the request for allotment shall be prescribed by the Commissioner and shall be submitted to him at least twenty-five days prior to the beginning of the fiscal year showing the proposed quarterly allotments of the whole authorized appropriation for the department or agency. <BR><BR>
<LI>For purposes of the administration of the allotment system herein provided, each fiscal year shall be divided into four quarterly allotment periods beginning, respectively, on the first day of July, October, January, and April: <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Provided</SPAN>, That in any case where the quarterly allotment period is found to be impracticable, the Commissioner may prescribe a different period suited to the circumstances but not extending beyond the end of the fiscal year. <BR><BR>
<LI>Each request for allotment shall be reviewed by the Budget Commissioner and the respective amounts therein shall be allotted for expenditures, provided the estimate therein is within the terms of the appropriations as to amount and purpose, having due regard for the probable future needs of the bureau, office or agency for the remainder of the fiscal year or other term for which the appropriation was made, and provided the bureau, office or agency contemplates expenditure of the allotment during the period. Otherwise, the said Budget Commissioner shall modify the estimate so as to conform with the terms of the appropriation and the prospective needs of the bureau, office or agency, and shall reduce the amount to be allotted accordingly. The Budget Commissioner shall act promptly upon all requests for allotment and shall notify every bureau, office or agency of its allotments at least five days before the beginning of each allotment period. The total amount allotted to any bureau, office or agency for the fiscal year or other term for which the appropriation was made shall not exceed the amount appropriated for said year or term. The notification, which will be sufficient authority for the Chief Accountant to enter the allotment in the books, shall include an explanation for any decrease or increase in the request of the head of the department or agency. <BR><BR>
<LI>At the end of each quarter, each department or agency must report to the Commissioner the current status of its appropriations, the cumulative allotments, obligations, expenditures, and unliquidated obligations and unobligated and unexpended balances; and the results of expended appropriations. Such department or agency may, at any time, initiate or request for a change in allotments order to adopt its functions or activities to altered conditions. <BR><BR>
<LI>The Commissioner shall have authority also at any time to modify or amend any allotment previously made by him. In case he shall find at any time that the probable receipts from taxes or other sources for any fund will be less than were anticipated and that as a consequence the amount available for the remainder of the term of the appropriations, or for any allotment period will be less than the amount estimated or allotted therefor, he shall, with the approval of the President, and after notice to the department or agency concerned, reduce the amount or amounts to be allotted so as to prevent deficits. <BR><BR>
<LI>The Commissioner shall promptly transmit records and modifications thereof to the Auditor General, the Chairman of the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations and Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of Finance. <BR><BR>
<LI>The Commissioner shall maintain control records showing quarterly by funds, accounts, and other pertinent classifications, the amounts appropriated, the estimated revenues, the actual revenues or receipts, the amounts allotted and available for expenditures, the unliquidated obligations, actual balances on hand, and the unencumbered balances of the allotments for each agency of the Government.baby<BR></LI></OL></BLOCKQUOTE>SEC. 16. <EM>Creation of appropriation reserves.</EM>—The Budget Commissioner shall in consultation with the head of the department or agency, establish reserves against appropriations to provide for contingencies and emergencies which may arise later in the fiscal year and which would otherwise require a deficiency appropriation. <BR><BR>The establishment of appropriation reserves should not necessarily mean that such portion of the appropriation will not be made available for expenditure. All or a portion of an appropriation may be reserved by the Budget Commissioner when he has determined that the amounts Evolved may not be needed. Should conditions change during the fiscal year which would justify the use of the reserve, the necessary adjustment may be made by the Budget Commissioner when requested by the Department or agency affected. <BR><BR>SEC. 17. <EM>Certification of availability of funds.</EM>—No funds shall be disbursed, and no expenditures or obligation chargeable against any authorized allotments shall be incurred or authorized by any head of department or agency without first securing the certification of the corresponding Chief Accountant as to the availability of funds and allotment against which the expenditure or obligation may properly be charged. <BR><BR>SEC. 18. <EM>Adjustment of appropriations for reorganization.</EM>—When, under authority of law, a function or an activity is transferred or assigned from one agency to another agency, the balances of the appropriations which are determined by the head of such department to be available and necessary to finance or discharge the function or activity so transferred or assigned may, with the approval of the President, be transferred to and be available for use by, the agency to which said function or activity is transferred or assigned for any purpose for which said funds were originally available. Balances so transferred shall be credited to any applicable existing appropriation account or accounts or to any new appropriation account or accounts which are hereby authorized to be established, and shall be merged with funds in the applicable existing or newly established appropriation account or accounts and thereafter accounted for as one fund. <BR><BR>SEC. 19. <EM>Prohibition against use of appropriations for the payment of salaries and wages of officers or employees engaged in a strike against the Government.</EM>—Subject to existing civil service rules and regulations and the proper administrative proceedings, no part of the funds of, or available for expenditures by, any department or agency of the Government shall be used to pay the salaries or wages of any officer or employee who engages in a strike against the Government of the Republic of the Philippines or who is a member of an organization of government employees that in the opinion of the Secretary of Justice asserts the right to strike against the Government of the Republic of the Philippines or who in the opinion of said secretary of Justice advocates the overthrow of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines by force or violence: <EM>Provided</EM>, That for the purposes hereof an affidavit shall be considered sufficient evidence that the person making the affidavit has not contrary to the provisions of this section engaged in a strike against the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, is not a member of any organization of government employees that asserts the right to strike against the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, or that such person does not advocate and is not a member of an organization that advocates the overthrow of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines by force or violence. <BR><BR>SEC. 20. <EM>Prohibition against the incurrence of overdrafts.</EM>—All heads of departments and agencies shall not incur or authorize the incurrence of expenditures or obligations in excess of the amounts appropriated by law for their respective departments and agencies.
