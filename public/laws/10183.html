<P>SEC. 3. <EM>Authority of the National Telecommunications Commission. </EM>– The grantee shall secure from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), hereinafter referred to as the Commission, a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity or the appropriate permits and licenses for the construction, installation and operation of its telecommunications systems/facilities.

The Commission shall have the authority to regulate the construction and operation of its telecommunications systems. The grantee shall not use any frequency in the radio spectrum without having been authorized by the Commission.
