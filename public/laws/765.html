The grantee shall file a bond in the amount of ten thousand pesos to guaranty for the full compliance and fulfillment of the conditions under which this permit is granted, and shall not, during the lifetime of this permit, sell, transfer or, assign the same to another without the consent of Congress. <BR><BR>SEC. 3. In the event of any competing individual, partnership or corporation receiving from the Congress a similar temporary permit in which there shall be any term or terms more favorable than those herein granted or tending to place the herein grantee at any disadvantage, then such term or terms shall, <EM>ipso facto</EM>, become a part of the terms hereof and shall operate equally in favor of the grantee as in the case of said competing individual, partnership or corporation. <BR><BR>SEC. 4.
