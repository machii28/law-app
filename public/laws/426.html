F.) for the year nineteen hundred forty-eight except agricultural machineries and equipment and other machinery, materials and equipment for dollar-producing and dollar-saving industries.<BR><BR>SEC. 10. For the purpose of fixing the import quota for each article, goods, or commodity, the average annual C. I. F. value thereof for the year nineteen hundred forty-six, nineteen hundred forty-seven and nineteen hundred forty-eight shall be used as basis.<BR><BR>SEC. 11. Within thirty days after the Import Control Board as herein provided shall have fixed the import quota for each item of import, any importer desiring to import any such item may file an application with the Commissioner for an allocation of a portion of said import quota. Any ruling or resolution of the Import Control Board as provided in Republic Act Numbered Three hundred thirty to the contrary notwithstanding, the applicants may file their application within forty-five days after the approval of this Act.<BR><BR>SEC. 12. The portion of the import quotas available for old importers shall be allocated by the Commissioner among them in proportion to the annual average amount of their importation of the articles and on the evidence of the sales tax actually paid by them corresponding to the years nineteen hundred forty-six, nineteen hundred forty-seven and nineteen hundred forty-eight.

To qualify as new importer, one must be a Filipino citizen or a juridical entity at least sixty <EM>per centum</EM> of whose stock is owned by Filipino citizens.

Should there be no such new applicants or should the said reserved portion be not entirely covered by new applicants, the said reserved portion of the import quota or any balance thereof shall be allocated among the rest of the importers: <EM>Provided, further,</EM> That nothing contained in this section shall in any way impair or abridge the rights granted to citizens and juridical entities of the United States of America under the Executive Agreement signed on July fourth, nineteen hundred forty-six, between that country and the Republic of the Philippines.<BR><BR>SEC. 15. Any existing law, executive order or regulation to the contrary notwithstanding, no Government, office, agency, or instrumentality, except the Import Control Commissioner, shall allocate the import quota among the various importers: <EM>Provided,</EM> That the Philippine Rehabilitation and Trade Relief Administration shall have exclusive power and authority to determine and regulate the allocation of wheat flour, among importers.<BR><BR>Quota allocations of any importer for any particular article, including wheat flour, shall not be transferable.<BR><BR>It shall be illegal to cede, transfer, sell, rent, lease or donate, his or its import quota allocation or license, either directly or indirectly or by the use of any simulation, strategy or scheme, to persons or entities not entitled to import quota under the provisions of this Act, and any violation thereof shall be punishable with the forfeiture by the Commissioner of the import quota or license of the erring party without prejudice to his subjection to the penal provisions of this Act.<BR><BR>SEC. 16.

Applications for quota allocations shall be numbered correlatively, based on the chronological order of their filing showing the date and hour each application was filed. No application shall be acted upon unless action has been taken upon other applications previously filed thereto. Applications for quota allocations shall be stamped with the date and hour when it was filed and a corresponding receipt shall be issued to the applicant thereof showing the number of the application, the date and hour of filing, pursuant to the provisions of this section: <EM>Provided, moreover,</EM> That all import quota allocations and licenses pending at the time of the approval of this Act shall be considered new applications in the light of the provisions of this section.<BR><BR>SEC. 17.

Upon presentation of an import license duly issued by the Commissioner, the Central Bank shall issue to the holder thereof the corresponding exchange cover.<BR><BR>SEC. 19.
