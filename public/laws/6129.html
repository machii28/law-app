If, after such study or studies, the commission is of the opinion that such number of employees are receiving such wages, it shall, upon notice and hearing, recommend to the industry concerned the fixing of a minimum wage for such industry through voluntary collective bargaining between representatives of the employers and the employees within such industry: <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Provided, however,</SPAN> That nothing herein shall preclude the representatives of employers and employees in any industry from initiating collective bargaining for such purpose even without the recommendation of the commission.<BR></DIV><BR>

The Commission may seek the assistance of the Bureau of Labor Relations to assure the clean and orderly conduct of the elections to be held. No employees or employers of any enterprise belonging to the industry shall be excluded from participation in such elections. Nothing in this section, however, shall prevent the parties concerned from utilizing any other voluntary means of determining who shall act as their representatives in the industry wage bargaining contemplated in this Act.<BR></DIV><BR>
<DIV style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">"The Commission shall promulgate the necessary rules of procedure that shall govern the conduct of such representation elections:<SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic"> Provided, </SPAN>That such rules shall be given such publicity by the Commission as to give notice the parties, including posting of translations in the local dialect in conspicuous places in the places of work and business of those who will vote.<BR></DIV><BR>

<DIV style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">"(e) Any wage agreement arrived at as a result of industry-wide collective bargaining referred to above shall be submitted to the Commission, which shall issue a wage order incorporating the industry wage agreement within fifteen days from the date of submission.

<DIV style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">"(f) In the event representatives of employers and employees in an industry fail to arrive at or to submit a wage agreement within forty-five days after the date of recommendation by the Commission, it shall proceed to exercise its powers under section five hereof. Upon application of the parties, the commission may, however, grant an extension of the forty-five-day period if there is a showing that the parties will likely arrive at an agreement should bargaining be allowed to continue beyond this period."<BR></DIV><BR>
<DIV style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">"Sec. 5. <SPAN style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Wage Fixing By Commission.</SPAN>-(a) If for any reason an industry wage agreement is not arrived at by the parties concerned within the period provided in the next preceding section or because a substantial majority of the parties express their preference for the Commission to fix the appropriate minimum wages for such industry, it shall proceed to fix the same after notice and hearing.<BR></DIV><BR>
<DIV style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">"(b) Within sixty days from the date the commission assumes the exercise of its authority hereunder by notifying the parties thereof, the Commission shall promulgate a wage order establishing the minimum wage to be paid by employers in the industry or for the various branches thereof.<BR><BR>"(c) A minimum wage to be established by the commission shall be as nearly adequate as is economically feasible to maintain the minimum standard of living necessary for the health, efficiency, and general well-being of employees.

<DIV style="MARGIN-LEFT: 40px">"(e) A wage order shall take effect fifteen days after due notice is given of the issuance thereof by publication in two newspapers of general circulation and by such other means as the commission deems reasonably calculated to give to interested parties general notice of such-issuance.

Within such period, however, the Commission may decide to incorporate in a wage order new wage rates arrived at in a subsequent industry wage agreement resulting from voluntary negotiations or collective bargaining.<BR><BR>"(h) A minimum rate established by the wage commission shall in no way prevent individual workers' unions in particular firms or enterprises in the industry from bargaining for higher wages with their respective employers."<BR></DIV><BR>
