As soon as all the statements are before it, but not later than fifteen days next following the date of election, the Board shall proceed to make a canvass of all the votes cast in each district of the province or the City of Manila, as the case may be, and shall make separate statements of the votes received by each candidate for delegate for each district. Upon completion of the statement, the Board shall proclaim elected as delegates to the Constitutional Convention the candidates who shall have obtained the highest number of votes corresponding to the number of delegates allotted to the district.<BR>
<LI><EM>When Statements are Contradictory.</EM> — In case it appears to the Board of Canvassers that there exist another authentic copy or copies of returns from an election precinct submitted to the Board giving any candidate a different number of votes, or there is a difference in the words and figures of the number of votes for any candidate, and in either case the difference affects the result of the election, upon motion of the Board or of any candidate affected, and after due notice to all candidates in the district, the corresponding Court of First Instance shall proceed to determine summarily on the face of the original and copy or copies of the returns whether or not the contradiction or difference is the result of tampering, alteration or falsification of the original or any copy or copies thereof after they had been signed by the Board of Inspectors; and should it so find, it shall direct the Board to use whichever document or documents it finds authentic. Should the Court entertain any doubt as to which document is authentic, or should the contradiction or difference in their contents be an authentic discrepancy, and if there are no visible signs on the key or on the clamp to which the key is attached and/or on the ballot box of an attempt to open the box or replace the key nor signs of welding on any side which would give the court reasonable grounds to believe that the integrity of the ballot box has been violated, it may proceed to recount the votes cast in the precinct for the sole purpose of determining which is the true result of the count of the votes cast in the precinct in question: <EM>Provided, however,</EM> That if upon opening there are extraneous matters or visible signs of replacement or tampering, the court may not proceed to recount and shall forthwith close and seal the ballot box and deliver the same to the Commission on Elections for safekeeping. Should it be impossible to determine the true result of the count, the court shall instruct the Board that no votes shall be counted from the precinct.<BR>
<LI><EM>Correction of Statements.</EM> Whenever all the members of the Board of Elections Inspectors certify that they have committed an error or an omission in preparing an election return, on unanimous motion of the Board or of any candidate affected, and upon proof of notice to all candidates in the district, the proper Court of First Instance shall, after verifying the error or omission, proceed to correct the return.<BR>
<LI><EM>Effect of Orders in Pre-Proclamation Controversies.</EM> The decision made in any of the foregoing proceedings shall not be appealable, but it shall only be enforced five working days after receipt thereof by the Board. It shall not be binding in any election protest that may be filed after the proclamation of the winning candidate.</LI></OL><BR><BR>SEC. 7. <EM>Registration of Voters.</EM> — The registration of voters in the election of delegates to the Constitutional Convention shall continue to be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Republic Act Numbered Three thousand five hundred and eighty-eight, as amended by Republic Act Numbered Four thousand seven hundred and thirty: <EM>Provided,</EM> That for purposes of this election, the periods provided therein for special elections shall apply: <EM>Provided, further,</EM> That thirty days before election day, the Election Registration Board shall start posting in the polling places the corresponding precinct lists of voters and shall continue posting from time to time such supplementary lists as may be necessary to complete the list of voters in each precinct: <EM>Provided, finally,</EM> That not later than nine days before the day of the election, all Election Registrars shall inform by special delivery or other expeditious means of communication each registered voter in their respective jurisdictions of his precinct number and the exact location of his polling place.<BR><BR>SEC. 8. <EM>Prohibited Acts.</EM> In addition to and supplementing prohibited acts provided for in the Revised Election Code, in the election of delegates:<BR><BR>
