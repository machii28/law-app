<CENTER><B>CHAPTER II<BR><BR>ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF THE ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY</B><BR></CENTER><BR>SEC. 5. <EM>Organization.</EM> — The electric power industry shall be divided into four (4) sectors, namely: generation, transmission, distribution and supply.<BR><BR>SEC. 6. <EM>Generation Sector.</EM> — Generation of electric power, a business affected with public interest, shall be competitive and open.<BR><BR>Upon the effectivity of this Act, any new generation company shall, before it operates, secure from the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) a certificate of compliance pursuant to the standards set forth in this Act, as well as health, safety and environmental clearances from the appropriate government agencies under existing laws.<BR><BR>Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, power generation shall not be considered a public utility operation. For this purpose, any person or entity engaged or which shall engage in power generation and supply of electricity shall not be required to secure a national franchise.<BR><BR>Upon implementation of retail competition and open access, the prices charged by a generation company for the supply of electricity shall not be subject to regulation by the ERC except as otherwise provided in this Act.<BR><BR>Pursuant to the objective of lowering electricity rates to end-users, sales of generated power by generation companies shall be value added tax zero-rated.<BR><BR>The ERC shall, in determining the existence of market power abuse or anti-competitive behavior, require from generation companies the submission of their financial statements.<BR><BR>SEC. 7. <EM>Transmission Sector.</EM> — The transmission of electric power shall be a regulated common electricity carrier business, subject to the ratemaking powers of the ERC.<BR><BR>The ERC shall set the standards of the voltage transmission that shall distinguish the transmission from the subtransmission assets. Pending the issuance of such new standards, the distinction between the transmission and subtransmission assets shall be as follows: 230 kilovolts and above in the Luzon Grid, 69 kilovolts and above in the Visayas and in the isolated distribution systems, and 138 kilovolts and above in the Mindanao Grid: <EM>Provided, </EM>That for the Visayas and the isolated distribution system, should the 69 kilovolt line not form part of the main transmission grid and be directly connected to the substation of the distribution utility, it shall form part of the subtransmission system.<BR><BR>SEC. 8. <EM>Creation of the National Transmission Company.</EM> — There is hereby created a National Transmission Corporation, hereinafter referred to as TRANSCO, which shall assume the electrical transmission function of the National Power Corporation (NPC), and have the powers and functions hereinafter granted.

All transmission and subtransmission related liabilities of NPC shall be transferred to and assumed by the PSALM Corp.<BR><BR>TRANSCO shall negotiate with and thereafter transfer such functions, assets, and associated liabilities to the qualified distribution utility or utilities connected to such sub transmission facilities not later than two (2) years from the effectivity of this Act or the start of open access, whichever comes earlier: <EM>Provided, </EM>That in the case of electric cooperatives, the TRANSCO shall grant concessional financing over a period of twenty (20) years: <EM>Provided, however, </EM>That the installment payments to TRANSCO for the acquisition of subtransmission facilities shall be given first priority by the electric cooperatives out of the net income derived from such facilities. The TRANSCO shall determine the disposal value of the subtransmission assets based on the revenue potential of such assets.<BR><BR>In case of disagreement in valuation, procedures, ownership participation and other issues, the ERC shall resolve such issues.<BR><BR>The take over by a distribution utility of any subtransmission asset shall not cause a diminution of service and quality to the end-users. Where there are two or more connected distribution utilities, the consortium or juridical entity shall be formed by and composed of all of them and thereafter shall be granted a franchise to operate the subtransmission asset by the ERC.<BR><BR>The subscription rights of each distribution utility involved shall be proportionate to their load requirements unless otherwise agreed by the parties.<BR><BR>Aside from the PSALM Corp., TRANSCO and connected distribution utilities, no third party shall be allowed ownership or management participation, in whole or in part, in such subtransmission entity.<BR><BR>The TRANSCO may exercise the power of eminent domain subject to the requirements of the Constitution and existing laws. Except as provided herein, no person, company or entity other than the TRANSCO shall own any transmission facilities.<BR><BR>Prior to the transfer of the transmission functions by NPC to TRANSCO, and before the promulgation of the Grid Code, ERC shall ensure that NPC shall provide to all electric power industry participants open and non-discriminatory access to its transmission system. Any violation thereof shall be subject to the fines and penalties imposed herein.<BR><BR>SEC. 9. <EM>Functions and Responsibilities.</EM> — Upon the effectivity of this Act, the TRANSCO shall have the following functions and responsibilities:<BR>

<LI>In the public interest, establish and enforce a methodology for setting transmission and distribution wheeling rates and retail rates for the captive market of a distribution utility, taking into account all relevant considerations, including the efficiency or inefficiency of the regulated entities. The rates must be such as to allow the recovery of just and reasonable costs and a reasonable return on rate base (RORB) to enable the entity to operate viably. The ERC may adopt alternative forms of internationally-accepted rate-setting methodology as it may deem appropriate. The rate-setting methodology so adopted and applied must ensure a reasonable price of electricity. The rates prescribed shall be non-discriminatory. To achieve this objective and to ensure the complete removal of cross subsidies, the cap on the recoverable rate of system losses prescribed in Section 10 of Republic Act No. 7832, is hereby amended and shall be replaced by caps which shall be determined by the ERC based on load density, sales mix, cost of service, delivery voltage and other technical considerations it may promulgate. The ERC shall determine such form of rate-setting methodology, which shall promote efficiency. In case the rate setting methodology used is RORB, it shall be subject to the following guidelines:<BR><BR>
<OL type=i>
<LI>For purposes of determining the ratebase, the TRANSCO or any distribution utility may be allowed to revalue its eligible assets not more than once every three (3) years by an independent appraisal company: <EM>Provided, however, </EM>That ERC may give an exemption in case of unusual devaluation: <EM>Provided, further, </EM>That the ERC shall exert efforts to minimize price shocks in order to protect the consumers;<BR>
<LI>Interest expenses are not allowable deductions from permissible return on rate base;<BR>
<LI>In determining eligible cost of services that will be passed on to the end-users, the ERC shall establish minimum efficiency performance standards for the TRANSCO and distribution utilities including systems losses, interruption frequency rates, and collection efficiency;<BR>
<LI>Further, in determining rate base, the TRANSCO or any distribution utility shall not be allowed to include management inefficiencies like cost of project delays not excused by <EM>force majeure, </EM>penalties and related interest during construction applicable to these unexcused delays; and<BR>
<LI>Any significant operating costs or project investments of the TRANSCO and distribution utilities which shall become part of the rate base shall be subject to verification by the ERC to ensure that the contracting and procurement of the equipment, assets and services have been subjected to transparent and accepted industry procurement and purchasing practices to protect the public interest.<BR></LI></OL><BR>

<LI>Distribution utilities may enter into bilateral power supply contracts subject to review by the ERC: <EM>Provided, </EM>That such review shall only be required for distribution utilities whose markets have not reached household demand level. For the purpose of preventing market power abuse between associated firms engaged in generation and distribution, no distribution utility shall be allowed to source from bilateral power supply contracts more than fifty percent (50%) of its total demand from an associated firm engaged in generation but such limitation, however, shall not prejudice contracts entered into prior to the effectivity of this Act.
