It shall sit with open doors, unless otherwise ordered by an affirmative vote of six members. It shall keep a record of its proceedings and determine its rules of procedure not herein set forth.  Six members of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.  But a smaller number may adjourn from day to day and may compel the immediate attendance of any member absent without good cause by issuing to the police of the city an order for his arrest and production at the session under such penalties as shall have been previously prescribed by ordinance.  Six affirmative votes shall be necessary for the passage of any ordinance, or of any resolution or motion directing the payment of money or creating liability, but any other measure shall prevail upon the majority votes of the members present at any meeting duly called and held.  The <EM>ayes</EM> and <EM>nays</EM> shall be taken and recorded upon the passage of all ordinances, upon all resolutions or motions directing the payment of money or creating liability, and, at the request of any member, upon any other resolution or motion.

Within ten days after the receipt of the ordinance resolution, or motion, the Mayor shall return it with his approval or veto.  If he does not return it within that time, it shall be deemed to be approved.  If he returns it his veto, his reasons therefor in writing shall accompany it.  It may then be again enacted by the affirmative vote of eight members of the Board and again forwarded to the Mayor for his approval, and if within ten days after its receipt he does not again return it with his veto, it shall be deemed to be approved.  If within said time he again returns it with his veto, it shall be forwarded forthwith to the Executive Secretary for his approval or disapproval, which shall be final.  The Mayor shall have the power to veto any particular item or items of an appropriation ordinance, or of an ordinance, resolution or motion directing the payment of money or creating liability, but the veto shall not affect the item or items to which he does not object.  The item or items objected to shall not take effect in the manner heretofore provided in this section as to ordinances, resolutions, and motions returned to the Board with his veto, but should an item or items in an appropriation ordinance be disapproved by the Mayor, the corresponding item or items in the appropriation ordinance of the previous year shall be deemed restored unless otherwise expressly directed in the veto.<BR><BR>"The Executive Secretary shall have full power to disapprove directly, in whole or in part, any ordinance, resolution or motion of the Municipal Board if he finds said ordinance, resolution or motion or parts thereof, beyond the powers conferred upon the Board."</BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>SEC. 3.
